Paths and Nodes
<hr noshade size=3>
   The commands INDEX, HELP, NEXT, PREV, TOC and the all purpose hypertext
link specify other nodes to jump to.  They all support the naming of nodes
within the current document, but they also all support a path along with
that name which lets the node be located in any Amigaguide document.

   It is really the essence of the simple.  To access a node in another
document, simply put an AmigaDOS file path before the node name.  You do
not need a complete path including a volume name, if you are sure that the
file is going to be where it should be (generaly, if it is not in the same
directory as the main document, you should use a full path, maybe an
assigned volume name).  Some example paths are:  "s:help.guide/main",
"Amigaguide.guide/Copyright".

   If you are running AmigaOS 3.0 or above, you can jump to any file that is
supported by Datatypes - pictures, animation, anything.  You must still
give a "node" name, even though the file is not an Amigaguide file and has
no "nodes" - so just use "main":  "picture.iff/main".
