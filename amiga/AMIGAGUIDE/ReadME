Release Notes
=============
amigaguide.library 34.4

 o Wasn't freeing the library base properly when expunging.

amigaguide.library 34.8

 o Now sets the ofh_TOC, ofh_Next and ofh_Prev from dynamic node hosts.

 o Now handles 8 bit-plane deep screens.

 o No longer ghosts NEXT button if the last node has a @NEXT
   command.

 o No longer ghosts PREV button if the first node has a @PREV
   command.

 o No longer displays silly little vertical bars when
   encountering V39 attribute commands.

 o / is now a keyboard shortcut for Retrace (like in MultiView).


amigaguide.library 34.9

 o Fixed a bug in LoadXRef() that would cause it to drop names.

 o Added AGA_WorkPath and AGA_WorkNode attributes to GetAmigaGuideAttr().
   The destination path should be at least 300 bytes and the node name
   should be at least 128 bytes.

   /* If we can get one of these, we can get the other */
   if (GetAmigaGuideAttr (AGA_WorkPath, aghandle, (ULONG *) &paddr))
   {
       GetAmigaGuideAttr (AGA_WorkNode, aghandle, (ULONG *) &naddr);
       printf ("database='%s', node='%s'\n", path, node);
   }

   This feature allows your utilities to remember the last node visited,
   so that the database can be brought back up at the same place.

amigaguide.library 34.10

 o Now checks for the presence of nag_BaseName and if NULL supplies
   AmigaGuide.

amigaguide.library 34.11

 o Recompiled with SAS/C 6.3

 o Wasn't handling improperly terminated link commands properly.  It would
   end up trashing memory.   Now will terminated at the end of a line.

 o new include/librries/amigaguide.h for V34 amigaguide development
   (i.e. don't overwrite a V39 amigaguide,h with this)


AD2AG 39.2

 o AD2AG no longers provides an unwanted MungWall hit when
   parsing include files.


AmigaGuide 34.3

 o Now sets return code properly
