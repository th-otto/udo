   Like other people, I did not have a single concise source for all the
Amigaguide commands and how they work (or don't as the case may be).  So I
decided to write one.  I believe I have covered all the commands from the
earliest Amigaguide to the latest (release 3.1 of AmigaOS).

   I've also considered writting more about how to work with Amigaguide as
a programer (how to work with dynamic hosts, the Amigaguide Datatype, etc),
but that will only come later if there is a demand.  I also thought about
doing a general tutorial on writting Amigaguide documents (or Texinfo
documents for that matter).

   I don't claim to be any expert on Amigaguide, but, I do think I do a
fairly good job at rounding up information and compiling it into a nice
readable form.  I hope you will agree.
