   Amigaguide commands all begin with the '@' (pronounced 'at') symbol.
Most commands must start at the very begining of a line, and should be the
only thing that is on that line.  Although not required for most commands,
you should probably write them all in capital letters as a matter of
discipline (it also makes them much easier to see and keep track of!).

   There are three catagories of commands:  Global, Node, and Attributes.
Global commands are usualy specified at the begining of the document,
before any nodes are defined, and apply to all the nodes in the document.
Technicaly, they could be anywhere.  Many commands can be used both globaly
and in nodes.

   Node commands are usable inside of a node (after a '@NODE' and before an
"@ENDNODE"), and affect only the node in which they are used.

   Attributes may be specified anywhere in a normal line.  In addition to
the '@' symbol, attributes always use a pair of braces ('{' and '}') to
enclose the attribute name and possibly additional arguments.

   Many commands have been introduced over time, so some commands require a
minimum OS version.  These commands may be used without too much worry
about compatibility since older versions of Amigaguide largely ignore
unknown commands.  Where a command only works on more recent versions of
the OS, they will be followed by a "V39" or "V40", otherwise they work on
any Amiga.  V39 is AmigaOS/Workbench release 3.0 (only on A1200's and
A4000's), and V40 is release 3.1 (available to anyone willing to pay
through the butt for it).

   To avoid complications in viewing this document with Amigaguide, all the
commands listed will not include the necessary '@' - but don't forget it
when you are authoring an Amigaguide document!
