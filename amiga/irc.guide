@node ! "Recall previous commands"
Usage: ![history number|history match]
  The ! command is used to recall previous commands in your command
  history for re-execution.  The ! command is unique in that when it
  is used, it leaves the matching history entry in the input line for
  re-editting.  You can specify a history entry either by its number
  in the history list, or by a match with a given wildcard expression.
  For example:
    /!10
  will put entry 10 in the history list into the input line.
  The following:
   /!/MSG 
  will search the history list for a line beginning with /MSG and
  put it in the input line (an * is implied at the end of /MSG).  When
  using ! command with a wildcard expression, subsequent uses of
  the ! command continue their search in the history list from where 
  they left off.  This is reset to the end of the list when a command
  is executed that adds an entry to the history list. Also, if a
  wildcard expression is used once, subseqent uses of ! with no
  expression will use the previous wild card expression.  For example,
  the following: 
    /!/MSG
    /!
  The first call returns the first match of /MSG in the history list, 
  and the second returns the next match, and so on.  This is useful 
  in the following key binding:
    /BIND ^R PARSE_COMMAND /!$"Search: "
  With this, you can hit ^R and you will be prompted for a search
  string in the history list.  If you want to then repeat the search
  you simply have to hit ^R and hit return, since it will use
  the previous search by default.
  
  Lastly, ! may be used in command aliases as well.  When it is
  embedded in an alias it simply executes the matching history entry
  without first putting it in the input line for re-editting.

    @{" HISTORY " link HISTORY }
@endnode

@node # "Comment-Sign for Scripts"
Usage in scripts and aliases.
It's identical to COMMENT and does nothing.
@endnode

@node ADMIN "Shows a server-administrator"
Usage: ADMIN [server]
  Displays the administrative details about the given server.  If
  no server is specified, the server you are connected to is
  used.
@endnode

@node ASSIGN "Sets a variable"
Usage: ASSIGN [-][user-variable] [whatever]
  ASSIGN lets you create user variables which are automatically
  expanded by IRCII in aliases using the $variable-name format.
  For example, if you had defined:
    /ASSIGN me The Big Cheese
  Then, in an alias, $me would expand to "The Big Cheese".  These
  are straight textual substitutions.  You can use these kind
  of variables as counters and indexes into lists as well.  For
  example:
	/ASSIGN index 0
	/ASSIGN index ${index+1}
  The first line sets "index" to 0, the seconds increments index by 1.
  Note that the second will always be expanded if used in another
  alias (where $ are normally expanded).  If you want it to be
  expanded if typed at the input line, you must first set
  INPUT_ALIASES to ON.

  Note: In the above example, the mathematical expression must be
  enclosed by {}'s  otherwise the + would be treated as an alias
  delimiter and the addition not performed.

  Suppose now you wanted to use index to get a single word in a list, 
  you could do:
	/ALIAS WORD /ECHO $($index)
  Then doing:
	/WORD This is a test
  would display the index'th word in the list.  
  The $($index) format does the following: it parses the text
  between the () as a sub-alias.  The "$index" is thus evaluated
  and returns it's value.  This value is then replaced for the () 
  expression and evaluated.  So, if you had:
	/ASSIGN index 1
  Then, the following would be evaluated:
	$index becomes 1 which given
	$(1) which becomes simply $1
  Thus the $1 arguement is used.  
  This functionality can be nested. This the following:
	/ASSIGN A Hey You!
	/ASSIGN B A
	/ASSIGN C B
	/ALIAS NESTING /echo $($($C))
  will cause /NESTING to display "Hey You!"

  The following format are also legal:
    $#name	evaluates to the number of words in name
    $@name	evaluates to the number of characters in name
  You can use these with the mathematical expressions as well, 
  for example:
    /ASSIGN foo Testing One Two
    /ECHO $#foo $@foo
    /ASSIGN junk ${#foo + @foo}
  The ECHO line will display 3 15 and the variable junk have the 
  value 18.

  Additionally, values assigned to FUNCTION_RETURN are taken to be
  the return value of a function.

@endnode

@node AWAY "Marks you as away"
Usage: AWAY [away message]
  Marks you as "away".  Whenever someone sends you a MSG or a
  does a WHOIS on you, they automatically see whatever message
  you set.  While you are away, all messages you receive will be
  timestamped and you will optionally get beeped (see SET 
  BEEP_WHEN_AWAY) for each message.  Using AWAY with no
  parameters marks you as no longer being away.

  See Also:
    @{" SET BEEP_WHEN_AWAY " link SETBEEP_WHEN_AWAY }

@node BASICS "Some basics for newusers"
Irc is a multi-user, multi-channel chatting network.  It allows
people all over the internet to talk to one another in real-time.
Each irc user has a nickname they use.  All communication with
another user is either by nickname or by the channel that they or
you are on.  All IRCII commands begin with a / character.
Anthing that does not begin with a / is assumed to be a message
that is sent to everyone on your channel.  Here is a list of
basic commands to help you get started:
    / @{" LIST " link LIST }             Lists all current irc channels, number of
                         users, and topic.
    / @{" NAMES " link NAMES }            Shows the nicknames of all users on each
                         channel
    / @{" JOIN " link JOIN } <channel>   Join the named channel.  All non-commands
                         you type will now go to everyone on that
                         channel
    / @{" MSG " link MSG } <nick> <msg> Sends a private message to the specified
                         person.  Only the specified nickname will
                         see this message.
    / @{" NICK " link NICK }             Change your nickname
    / @{" QUIT " link QUIT }             Exits irc.
    / @{" HELP " link HELPIRC } <topic>     Gets help on all IRCII commands.
    / @{" WHO " link WHO } <channel>    Shows who is on a given channel,
                         including nickname, user name and host,
                         and realname.
    / @{" WHOIS " link WHOIS } <nick>     Shows the "true" indentity of someone

These commands should get you started on irc.  Use the / @{" HELP " link HELPIRC }
command to find out more about things on irc, or ask question of
people... most would be happy to help you out.
@endnode

@node BYE "Exit IRC"
Usage: BYE
  Quits your IRC session.
  @{" QUIT " link QUIT } @{" EXIT " link EXIT } and @{" SIGNOFF " link SIGNOFF } are identical.
@endnode

@node CD "Change directory"
Usage: CD [path]
  If a path is specified, this changes IRCIIs working directory. 
  This is the default directory for EXEC's and other things
  (such as logs) that don't have absolute paths specified.
  CD with no arguments shows you the current directory.

@endnode

@node CHANNEL "Join a channel"
Usage:  CHANNEL [<channel>|-INVITE|-NICK <nickname>]
  Changes your current channel to the channel specified.  If the
  -INVITE switch is used, you will join the channel that you were
  last INVITED to.  Or, if we wish to be grammatically correct,
  you will join the channel to which you were last invited.  If
  the -NICK format is used, you will join the channel that the
  specified nickname is on.  If no parameters are given, your current
  channel is displayed.

  Information about the different channels:
    Channel 0 is the limbo channel.
    Channels 1 thru 999 are public.
    Channels 1000 and up are private channels
    Channels below 0 are private/invisible channels.
    Channels may contain alphabetic characters if they
      begin with a + character.  For example:
	+My_Channel
      is a valid channel name.	
    With server version 2.6 and beyond, there is a new channel
    type.  A channel may begin with a # character.  The
    following characters may be alphanumeric like +
    channels.  However, you may join more than one # 
    channel at a time.  You can still be on 1 numeric
    or + channel and up to (at last check) 10 # channels.

  CHANNEL and @{" JOIN " link JOIN } are identical.
  See HELP MODE for information about changing channel characteristics.
@endnode

@node CLEAR "Clear Window"
Usage: CLEAR [-ALL]
  Clears the current window.  If the -ALL flag is used, clears all visible
  windows.
@endnode

@node COMMANDS "Some basics for newusers"
All IRCII commands must begin with one of the CMDCHAR settings
(see @{" SET CMDCHARS " link SETCMDCHARS } ).  By default, this is set to /.  Thus, any
input line whose first character is a / is treated as an IRCII
command.  For example:

/MSG BigCheese Howdy!

This executes the MSG command, which sends a private message to 
"BigCheese", and that message is "Howdy!"

You can create aliases for commands or redefine what an existing
command does.  This is done with the @{" ALIAS " link ALIAS } command.  For example:

/ALIAS M /MSG

This example creates a new command, M, which does the same thing
as @{" MSG " link MSG } , you can now do:

/M BigCheese Howdy!

and it will work exactly like MSG.  Suppose however you did this:

/ALIAS MSG //MSG BigCheese

Now, the MSG command will only send messages to BigCheese:

/MSG Howdy!

Note that in the alias, there are two / in front of MSG.  Putting
two of the @{" CMDCHARS " link SETCMDCHARS } in front of a command tells IRCII that you
want to use the original command, and not any alias of it.
Therefore, even if you had the above alias for MSG, you could
still do the following:

//MSG Cheese I can still use the original MSG command.

Furthermore, if you wish you can turn off your display 
(See @{" SET DISPLAY " link SETDISPLAY } ) for the duration of a command.  This is
done by putting a ^ character between the / and the command
word.  For example, if you do:

/^MSG BigCheese Hello

You will not see any visible effect to this command (unless the
nickname BigCheese does not currently exist).

Lastly, if you do the following:

/ /this is a test

Note there is a space after the /.  This form forces the following
text to be sent to your current channel no matter what.  You can
thus send lines that begin with your @{" CMDCHARS " link SETCMDCHARS } .  It can also
be used to force a message to your current channel when you are
using @{" QUERY " link QUERY }.
@endnode

@node COMMENT "Sets a comment in a script"
Usage: COMMENT <anthing you want>
  This is a comment, does nothing.  Useful in .ircrc files.
@endnode

@node CONNECT "Attempts to connect another server (Operator-Command)"
Usage remote: CONNECT <serverX> <port> <serverY>
  Attempts to connect serverY to serverX on the given port.


@endnode

@node DATE "Shows time/date"
Usage: DATE [server]
  Shows the current time of day and date.  If a server is
  specified, the time of day and date are reported from that
  server.  DATE and @{" TIME " link TIME } are identical.

@endnode

@node DESCRIBE "Describes an Action"
Usage: /DESCRIBE <nickname|channel> <action description>
    This command can be used to send a description of what you are doing
    or how you are feeling or just about anything concerning you, to the
    person or channel you pass as first argument.

/DESCRIBE BigCheese takes a flask of whisky out of the fridge.

    is supposed to produce a line on BigCheese's screen stating:

Lynx takes a flask of whisky out of the fridge.

    This command makes use of CTCP and is not understood by all clients.
    If you get an error message, your description has not arrived properly.

  See Also:
    @{" ME " link ME }
    @{" LOAD ACTION " link ACTION }
    @{" LOAD MUD " link MUDLIKE }
    @{" CTCP " link CTCP }
    @{" CTCP CLIENTINFO " link CLIENTINFO }
@endnode

@node DIE "Shutdown a server (Operator-Command)"
Usage: DIE
  Causes your server to exit, die, pack it in, give up the ship,
  etc.

@endnode

@node DMSG "Send message across a direct client client connection"
Usage: DMSG nickname
    DMSG sends a message across a direct client connection to the given
    nickname. The connection must first have been established with DCC
    CHAT. DMSG messages are the most secure messages you can send to
    another user on IRC, as they are passed directly from your client
    to the client of the recipient, without passing through servers.
  See Also:
    @{" MSG " link MSG }
    @{" DCC CHAT " link CHAT }
@endnode

@node DQUERY "Starts a DCC conversation with someone"
Usage: DQUERY [nickname]
  Starts a DCC conversation with [nicknames].  All text you
  type that would normally be sent to your channel now goes to
  [nicknames] in the form of DMSGs.  To cancel a DCC
  conversation, use DQUERY with no arguments.

  See Also:	
    @{" DCC CHAT " link CHAT }
    @{" DMSG " link DMSG }
@endnode

@node ECHO "Print a text"
Usage: ECHO <anything you want>
  This simply displays all of it's arguments.  However, it's not
  that simple.  ECHO will work even if DISPLAY is set to OFF,
  making it useful in your .ircrc file.  Also, ECHO will work in
  the action portion of an ON command in all modes.  This can be
  used to redefine the way messages appear.

  See Also:
    @{" ON " link ON }
    @{" SET DISPLAY " link SETDISPLAY }
    @{" XECHO " link XECHO }
@endnode

@node ENCRYPT "Encrypt MSG's"
Usage: ENCRYPT [nickname|channel] [key]
  ENCRYPT allows you to hold an encrypted conversations with 
  a person or a whole channel.  Once a nickname/channel and
  key is specified, all messages you send to that 
  nickname/channel will automatically be encrypted using the
  given key.  Likewise, any messages from that nickname/channel
  will automatically be decrypted.  IRCII is smart enough to know
  if the incoming message isn't encrypted and will not attempt to 
  decrypt it.  If you received an encrypted message from someone
  for whom you haven't specified a key, it will be displayed as
  [ENCRYPTED MESSAGE].  

  The [key] can be any text which is to be used an they key 
  for encryption/decryption of the conversation.  It is up to
  you and the people you wish to talk to about how to agree upon 
  a key and how to communcate it to one another.

  For example, if user CheeseDog wishes to talk encryptedly with
  user DogCheese, they must first agree on an encryption key
  (case sensitive), say foo.  Then user CheeseDog must issue a
    ENCRYPT DogCheese foo
  and user DogCheese must issue a 
    ENCRYPT CheeseDog foo
  Thereafter, all messages sent between CheeseDog and DogCheese
  will be encrypted and decrypted automatically.  

  If ENCRYPT is given with a nickname but no key, then encrypted
  conversation is ended with that user.  If ENCRYPT is given with
  no arguments, the list of encrypted user and keys are
  displayed.

  IRCII uses a built in encryption method that isn't terribly secure.
  You can use another if you so choose, see SEE @{" SET ENCRYPT_PROGRAM " link SETENCRYPT_PROGRA }
  for information about this.
 
  If you are sending encrypted messages to a user or channel, you
  can toggle it off and on in a message line by inserting the
  control-E character in the input line.  This is usually done
  by hitting control-Q then control-E.  An inverse video E will
  appear in the input line.

@node ETIQUETTE "Some basics for newusers"

HOW TO BEHAVE ON IRC

Authors:      Lea Viljanen (LadyBug)  viljanen@kreeta.helsinki.fi
              Ari Husa     (luru)     so-luru@tolsun.oulu.fi 
Modified by:  Troy Rollo   (Troy)     troy@plod.cbme.unsw.oz.au



1) Language

   The most widely understood and spoken language on IRC is English. 
However! As IRC is used in many different countries, English is by
no means the only language. If you want to speak some other language
than English (for example with your friends), go to a separate channel
and set the topic (with / @{" Topic " link TOPIC } ) to indicate that. For example
   /topic Finnish only!
would mean that this channel would be reserved for Finnish discussion.
On the other hand, you should check the topic (with /list command) 
before you move to a channel to see if there are any restrictions about 
language.
   On a channel not restricted by /topic, please speak a language
everybody can understand. If you want to do otherwise, change channels
and set the topic accordingly.


2) Hello/Goodbye

   It's not necessary to greet everybody on a channel personally.
Usually one "Hello" or equivalent is enough. And don't expect everybody
to greet you back. On a channel with 20 people that would mean one
screenful of hellos. It's sensible not to greet, in order not to be rude
to the rest of the channel. If you must say hello to somebody you know,
do it with a private / @{" Msg " link MSG } . The same applies to goodbyes.

   Also note that using IRCII's / @{" ON " link ONGR } facility to automatically say hello
or goodbye to people is extremely poor etiquette. Nobody wants to receive
autogreets. They are not only obviously automatic, but even if you think
you are being polite you are actually sounding insincere and also
interfering with the personal environment of the recipient when using
autogreets. If somebody wants to be autogreeted on joining a channel,
they will autogreet themselves.


3) Discussion

   When you come to a new channel it's advised you to listen
for a while to get an impression of what's discussed. Please feel free
to join in, but do not try to force your topic into the discussion
if that doesn't come naturally.


** 4) Limits

   On channel numbers above 10 there can be only 10 persons
per channel. So if the channel is full and you don't actively
participate, please move to another channel to let someone else in.


5) {}|[]\

   IRC has quite a lot of people from Scandinavian countries,
the above characters are letters in their alphabet. This 
has been explained on IRC about a thousand and one times, so
read the following, do not ask it on IRC:

   {     is an A with 2 dots over it
   }     is an A with a small circle above it
   |     is either an O with 2 dots over it or an O with a dash (/) through it
   [, ], and \ are the preceding three letters in upper case.


6) ATTENTION!

   Remember, people on IRC form their opinions about you only by 
your actions, writings and comments on IRC. So think before you type.

  EXEC allows you to start subprocesses in IRCII and manipulate
  them in various ways.  You can start multiple subprocesses
  simultaneously and access them via a process number assigned
  by IRCII.  You can list all currently running subprocesses by
  using EXEC with no parameters.  The process id of a process
  is the number assigned by IRCII for that process, or the 
  name of the process given by the -NAME flag.  If a NAME is 
  given to a process, that name may be used anyway in place of
  the process number assigned by IRCII.

  The first form of EXEC will simply start a subprocess and send
  it's output to your display.

  The second form tells IRCII to send the output of the process
  to your current channel.  For example:
    EXEC -OUT ls
  sends the output of ls to your channel.  
    EXEC -OUT %1
  tells IRCII to send the output of subprocess 1 to your
  channel.  Subprocess 1 must exist already by a previous call
  to EXEC.

  The third form is much like the second, except that it sends
  to the specified nickname or nicknames (the format of the
  nicknames is the same as for MSG).  As with the second form,
  you can start a subprocess with -MSG, or you can change an
  already running process to send it's output to the given
  nicknames.

  The fourth form lets you send a line of input to a running
  subprocess.  For example:
    EXEC -IN %shell This is a test.
  Sends "This is a test." to subprocess 0.  This processes must
  have prevously been started with a call to EXEC -NAME shell. 
  An alternate method of sending text to processes is using the 
  MSG or QUERY command.  In the place of a nickname, you may 
  specify %n, when  n is a current running processes id.   For 
  example:
    MSG %shell This is a test.
  is equivalent to the previous example.

  The fifth form lets you specify that you want all output from
  the process to go to the current window.  Normally, output
  from processes goes to whichever window has a level setting of
  CRAP.  This locks the output into the current window.  
    EXEC -WINDOW %1
  Sends the output of process 1 to the current window.

  The last form lets you send various signals to subprocesses.
  The allowable signals are:
    HUP     INT     QUIT     ILL     TRAP     IOT     EMT
    FPE     KILL    BUS      SEGV    SYS      PIPE    ALRM
    TERM    URG     STOP     TSTP    CONT     CHLD    TTIN
    TTOU    IO      XCPU     XFSZ    VTALRM   PROF    WINCH
    LOST    USR1    USR2
  What these signals do depends on the process running, etc.
    EXEC -KILL %0
  Sends a KILL signal to process 0, forcing it to exit
  immediately.  If you want to read more about these signals, do
  a "man kill" at your shell prompt.

  The last form is for really ornery processes that simply won't
  die.  Sometimes this is because an EXEC'd process has forked
  off subprocesses which don't die when you use -KILL (or other
  flag).  Doing a:
    EXEC -CLOSE %0
  closes all of IRCII's connections to that processes.  This means 
  that even if the processes is still sending output you won't see
  it.  This also means (in most cases) that the process will be
  killed by a SIGPIPE when it tries to send to IRCII.

@node EXIT "Exit IRC"
Usage: EXIT
  Quits your IRC session.
  @{" BYE " link BYE } @{" QUIT " link EXIT } and @{" SIGNOFF " link SIGNOFF } are identical.@endnode
@endnode

@node FLUSH "Flush server-output"
Usage: FLUSH
  Flushes all pending output from the server.  This has the
  effect of stopping long lists from the server, such as a @{" LINKS " link LINKS }
  command which can get quite lengthy.
@endnode

@node HELPIRC "Gives you help on IRC (not needed, you have THIS :) )"
Usage: HELP [command]
  Shows help on the given command.  The help documentation is 
  set up in a heirarchical fashion.  That means that certain
  help topics have sub-topics under them.  For example, doing
    /HELP ADMIN
  gives help on the admin command, while:
    /HELP SET
  gives help on the set command and also displays a list of
  sub-topics for SET.  If you are using IRCIIHelp, then to get
  help on the subtopics, you would do:
   /HELP SET <subtopic>
  where <subtopic> is one of the subtopics.  If you are using the 
  built in help, then you need only type the subtopic name.  The
  input prompt will indicate what help level you are on.  Hitting
  return will move you up one level.  

  At any time, you can specify a ? to get a list of subtopics 
  without the associated help file, for example:
    /HELP ?
  gives a list of all main help topics.  The follwoing:
    /HELP BIND ?
  gives the list of all BIND subtopics.  If you use a ? with 
  a topic that has no subtopics, you will simply get the 
  standard help file for that topic.

@node HISTORY "Shows you the command history"
Usage: HISTORY [number]
  Displays the command history to the screen.  You can specify
  the number of history entries you wish to view as well.
  
  See Also:
    @{" SET HISTORY " link SETHISTORY }
@endnode

@node IF "Execute command when a boolean expression is true/false"
Usage: IF boolean true-command [false-command]
  IF is a method of executing different commands depending on
  the truth of a boolean expression.  The boolean in the
  IF command can be one of the following:
	exp
	exp1=exp2
	exp1!exp2
	exp1>exp2
	exp1<exp2
  Here, exp, exp1, and exp2 can either be numeric or string data.
  If just exp is used, then the true-command is executed if exp is 
  either a non-empty string or a non-zero number.   Otherwise,
  false-command is executed.  If false-command is not present,
  no command is executed.
  In the other expressions, if both exp1 and exp2 are numeric, then 
  the following cause true-command to be executed:
	= 	if exp1 is equal to exp2
	!	if exp1 is not equal to exp2
	>	if exp1 is greater than exp2
	<	if exp1 is less than exp2
  Otherwise, false-command (if present) is executed.
  If both exp1 and exp2 are non-numeric, then the following cause
  true-command to be executed:
	=	if exp1 is the same as exp2
	!	if exp1 is not the same as exp2
	>	if exp1 is alphabetically greater than exp2
	<	if exp1 is alphabetically less than exp2
  All string comparisons are case-insensitive: so "Hello=HELLO"
  is true.  
  NOTE: No spaces are allowed in the boolean expression.  You can
  however put double quotes around a boolen expression to have it
  include more than one word.  

  Both the true-command and false-command may either be a single one
  word command, or you may surround a command and it's arguments in 
  double quotes.  

  Examples:
	/IF "$^!^=^<^>C" "/set input_prompt $C" "/set -input_prompt"
	/IF "$^!^=^<^>C!0" "/set input_prompt $C" "/set -input_prompt"
  Both of the above evaluate the same way, since $C will either expand 
  to your current channel or 0 if none.  If you aren't familiar with what
  $^!^=^<^>C means,  I'll explain.  $C expands to the current channel.
  Putting in ^c (where c is any character) tells IRCII to quote c with
  a \ before substitution.  Using ^!^=^<^> will cause any operators
  embedded in channel names to be quoted and not interfere with the 
  operation.
  
  NOTE: if you type the above examples in at the command line, the $C
  will only be converted if you have @{" INPUT_ALIASES " link SETINPUT_ALIASES } ON.  These examples
  will all work fine if embedded in an @{" ALIAS " link ALIASGR } .

	/IF "$USER=ms5n" "/echo Hello Mike!" "/echo Who the hell are you?"
  This example will look for an ASSIGN'd variable named USER, and if found
  replace it and compare to ms5n.  If no ASSIGN'd variable exists, it
  will check the environment variables for USER and return that.  

	/IF "$index>${max*2}" "/echo Limit reached"
  This checks the ASSIGN'd variable against the ASSIGN'd variable max times 2
  and displays "Limit reached" if the first is greater than the second.
  It does nothing if this is not true.
@endnode

@node IGNORE "Ignore MSG's/Notices from a user on IRC"
Usages: 
  IGNORE [nick] [-|+|^][message type]
  IGNORE [user@host] [-][message type]

  The standard form of IGNORE allows you to specify which type of
  messages you wish to ignore from a user.  The message type
  parameter can be one of the following:
    MSGS            All MSGs received
    NOTICES         All NOTICEs received
    PUBLIC          All normal channel conversation
    INVITES         All INVITEs received
    WALLS           All WALLs received
*    WALLOPS         All WALLOPS received
    NOTES           All NOTEs received
    ALL             All of the above message types
    NONE            No message types

  You can ignore by nickname or by specifying a userid@hostname
  format.  Wildcards may be used in all formats.  You can specify
  multiple types of messages to ignore on the command line.
  Preceeding a type with a - indicates removal of ignoring of
  that type of message.  For example:
     IGNORE BigCheese PRIVATE INVITES
  ignores MSGs and INVITES from BigCheese.  
     IGNORE *@*.cmu.edu ALL -WALLS
  ignores all types of messages except WALLS from anyone from
  CMU.  The user@host format is considerably slower than the
  nickname format and doesn't function for PUBLIC messages.

  You may also specify a + before any message type to cause messages
  of that type from that user to be displayed with the nickname
  highlighted.  For example:
    IGNORE *Cheese* +PRIVATE
  will cause all MSGs from anyone with Cheese in their nickname
  to appear with their nickname highlighted.  
    IGNORE * +WALLS +NOTES
  will highlight all WALLS and NOTES received.  The + has no effect with
  the user@host name format.

  If you specify a ^ before a message type, then messages from the
  matching nicknames will be displayed no matter what.  This allows
  you to exclude certain nicknames from larger matching lists.  For
  example:
    /IGNORE * MSG
    /IGNORE BigCheese ^MSG
  This will ignore private messages from everyone except BigCheese.
  
  All forms of IGNORE use the - to remove ignore attributes,
  and the type NONE will remove the user from the list
  completely.  

  All forms of IGNORE will match against the nickname with the
  most true matching characters.  What this means is if you have:
    IGNORE BigCheese PRIVATE
    IGNORE * +ALL
  Then MSG's from BigCheese will be ignored, and all other types
  of messages from BigCheese will be unaffected.  All messages
  of all types from any other user will be highlighted.

@node INFO "Shows information about the IRC creators"
Usage: INFO
  Shows information about the IRC creators.

  See also:
    @{" About this IRC.guide - File " link HELP }
@endnode

@node INVITE "Invite a User to a channel"
Usage: INVITE <nickname> [channel]
  Invites another user to a channel.  If no channel is specifed,
  your current channel is used.
@endnode

@node JOIN "Join a channel"
Usage:  JOIN [<channel>|-INVITE|-NICK <nickname>]
  Changes your current channel to the channel specified.  If the
  -INVITE switch is used, you will join the channel that you were
  last INVITED to.  Or, if we wish to be grammatically correct,
  you will join the channel to which you were last invited.  If
  the -NICK format is used, you will join the channel that the
  specified nickname is on.  If no parameters are given, your current
  channel is displayed.

  Information about the different channels:
    Channel 0 is the limbo channel.
    Channels 1 thru 999 are public.
    Channels 1000 and up are private channels
    Channels below 0 are private/invisible channels.
    Channels may contain alphabetic characters if they
      begin with a + character.  For example:
	+My_Channel
      is a valid channel name.	
    With server version 2.6 and beyond, there is a new channel
    type.  A channel may begin with a # character.  The
    following characters may be alphanumeric like +
    channels.  However, you may join more than one # 
    channel at a time.  You can still be on 1 numeric
    or + channel and up to (at last check) 10 # channels.

  @{" CHANNEL " link CHANNEL } and JOIN are identical.
  See HELP @{" MODE " link MODE } for about changing channel characteristics.
@endnode

@node KICK "Kick a user off a channel"
Usage: KICK <channel> <user>
  Kicks specified user off a given channel.  Only channel operators
  are privileged to use this command.  Channel operator privileges
  can be given to other users of channel by command
	/MODE <channel> +o <user>
  and taken away by command
	/MODE <channel> -o <user>
@endnode

@node KILL "Kill a user from IRC (Operator-Command)"
Usage: KILL <nickname> [comment]
  Removes a person from irc.  This is an operator command
  and should be used with extreme caution (if at all). The
  optional [comment] is usually supplied to indicate to 
  other operators the reason for the kill.  If you don't give
  a comment, you will probably be bombarded with messages
  saying "why the kill?"
@endnode

@node LASTLOG "Shows the contents of the lastlog"
Usage: LASTLOG [flag] [number of entries|string] [from entry]
  Displays the contents of the lastlog.  This is a list of the
  most recent messages that have appeared on the screen.  LASTLOG
  is useful to redisplay the screen if you inadvertantly do a
  /CLEAR or miss messages for other reasons.  If no arguments are
  given, the entire lastlog is displayed.  If the first argument
  is a number, it determines how many log entries to show.
  Otherwise it is searched for in every lastlog entry.  The
  second argument determines how many lines back to start display
  from.  Thus
    /LASTLOG 4 8
  Shows 4 lines of the lastlog, starting at line 8...  lines 8,
  9, 10, 11 are displayed.  Furthermore:
    /LASTLOG bigcheese
  displays only those lastlog entries that contain the word
  "bigcheese".  

  You can further limit the display of the lastlog by specifing
  one of the following flags:
    -PUBLIC		Normal channel messages
    -MSG		Private messages
    -NOTICE		Notices
    -NOTE		Notes
    -WALL		Walls
    -WALLOP		Wallops
    -CRAP		Anything not included in the other
			categories
  The lastlog will only display messages of the type specified
  by the flag.
  
  See Also:
    @{" SET LASTLOG " link SETLASTLOG }
    @{" SET LASTLOG_LEVEL " link SETLASTLOG_LEVEL }
@endnode

@node LEAVE "Leave a channel"
Usage: LEAVE <channel>
  Leave a channel.  This is used to leave a # channel while 
  remaining on all other channels you are on.  Of course, you can
  use LEAVE to leave from any channel, not just a # channel.
@endnode

@node LINKS "Shows the serverconnections"
Usage:  LINKS [servername]
  Shows all of the servers currently connected to the irc
  network.  If servername is specifed, LINKS shows any servers
  that match the given servername.  The servername may contain
  wildcards.
@endnode

@node LIST "Lists all channels"
Usage: LIST [flag [arg]] [channel] 
  LIST gives you a listing of channels which includes channel name,
  number of users, and a topic (if one is set).  If no channel
  is specified, all channels are shown, otherwise only channels
  that match are displayed (the channel may contain wildcards)
  The displayed list may also be limited by using one or more of 
  the following flags:
	-MIN n		When n the minimum number of user.  Channels
			with less than n users are not shown.
	-MAX n		When n the maximum number of user.  Channels
			with more than n users are not shown.
	-PUBLIC		Only shows Public channels
	-PRIVATE	Only shows Private (*) channels
	-ALL		Overrides previous -PUBLIC and/or -PRIVATE
	-TOPIC		Always show channels with a topic set
			(regardless of other switches)
@endnode

@node LUSERS "Shows you some stats about IRC"
Usage: LUSERS
  Gives a brief listing of the number of users, the number of
  servers and the number of operators.
@endnode

@node MAIL "Informations when you get UNIX-Mail"
  The MAIL command in previous versions of IRCII has been changed
  to NOTE.  This is to minimize confusion between the server's
  delayed messaging capability (now the NOTE command), and the 
  unix mail indicators built into IRCII.  If you get a message
  which says "You have new mail" or you see (Mail:1) in your
  status line, this means that you have unix mail and you should
  leave irc to read it.  
@endnode

@node ME "Action-description"
Usage: /ME <action description>
 or    /<your_nickname> <action description>

    This command can be used to send a description of what you are doing
    or how you are feeling or just about anything concerning you, to the
    current channel or query. When I type:

/ME opens up the fridge.

    it's supposed to produce a line on my talking partners screens stating:

Lynx opens up the fridge.

    You can also use your own nickname as command, that is you can type the
    line with a leading slash, like this:

/lynx reaches out for the orange juice.

    Hopefully resulting into:

Lynx reaches out for the orange juice.

    It is absolutely good style to not forget the period at the end!!

    This command makes use of CTCP and is not understood by all clients.
    If you get an error message, your description has not arrived properly.

  See Also:
    @{" DESCRIBE " link DESCRIBE }
    @{" LOAD ACTION " link ACTION }
    @{" LOAD MUD " link MUDLIKE }
    @{" CTCP " link CTCP }
    @{" CTCP CLIENTINFO " link CLIENTINFO }
@endnode

@node MODE "Changes the mode of a channel"
Usage: MODE <channel> [+|-]<modechars> <parameters>
  Mode command is quite complicated and it allows channel
  operators to change channel mode.  <modechars> is one of 
  the following:
    m           - channel is moderated (only channel operators talk)
    s           - channel is secret
    p           - channel is private
    l <number>  - channel is limited, where <number> is the
                  maximum number of users allowed
    t           - topic limits, only the channel operators may 
                  change it
    a           - channel is anonymous
    o <nick>    - Makes <nick> a channel operator
    i           - channel is invite only
    n           - No MSGs to the channel are allowed
  A + or - sign determines whether the specified mode should be
  added or deleted.  
@endnode

@node MOTD "Shows the servermessage-of-the-day"
Usage: MOTD [server]
  Gives the message-of-the-day for the named server.  If no
  server is given, your server is used.
@endnode

@node MSG "Sends a private message to a user or a channel"
Usage: MSG <nicknames|<channel>|%n|-CHANNEL <nickname>> <text of message>
  Sends a private message to the nicknames or list of nicknames
  specified.  A list of nicknames should by separated by commas
  (no spaces).  Two special case nicknames are defined.  If the
  nickname is "," (a comma), the message is sent to the last
  person who sent you a /MSG.  If the nickname is "."  (a
  period), the message is send to the last person to whom you
  send a message.  

  The second form allows you to specify a channel number or
  channel name to which to send the message.  The message will go
  to everyone on that channel.

  The third form lets you specify a process number to which the
  message will go, where n is the process number.  This works
  just like the EXEC -IN command.  For example:
    MSG %1 Homina homina homina
  will send the text to process 1.  Process 1 must be running
  already using a previous call to EXEC.
    
  The last form is similar to the second except that you can
  specify the channel to send a message to by giving the nickname
  of one to the people on the channel.  IRCII will look up the
  proper channel number or name and send the message.

*  There is also a use of wildcards for operators.
*  For example : /msg $*.edu will address all users having .edu
*                in their serverinfo.

@node NAMES "Shows all users who are currently on IRC"
Usage: NAMES [flag [arg]] [channel]
  Shows the nicknames of all users on all visible channels.
  If no channel is specifed, all channels are shown, otherwise
  only matching channels are shown (the channel may contain 
  wildcards).  The displayed list may also be limited by using 
  one or more of the following flags:
	-MIN n		When n the minimum number of user.  Channels
			with less than n users are not shown.
	-MAX n		When n the maximum number of user.  Channels
			with more than n users are not shown.
	-PUBLIC		Only shows Public channels
	-PRIVATE	Only shows Private (*) channels
	-ALL		Overrides previous -PUBLIC and/or -PRIVATE

__________________________________________________________________________
                             ircII 2.1.5      
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
> The command /who -h and -s is no more supported.
> Introduced { and } in scripts, see script/finger for an example.
  New also: You can indent things in a script. See Also /help load.
> Behaviour of HOLD_MODE has changed, won't hold when you are being active
  in that window. I like it a lot more, it's not so disturbing anymore.
> Away messages are displayed only once, when talking to someone who is away
  unless you /set show_away_once off.
> You don't get disturbed by cryptic but trivial CTCP requests, unless
  you /set verbose_ctcp on.
> Improved handling of process prompts, but INPUT_PROMPT must be set.
> ircII can now load scripts and help files in compressed form.
> All the scripts have been updated and many helpfiles written and
rewritten.  Many bugs have been fixed, support of newer server features
added, this client is already 2.7-capable.

> There have been major changes in the command parser. Commands are not
expected to have a leading / unless entered interactively, if you
experience incompatibilities, you will have to add 'say' and 'send'
wherever you have made aliases that send to the channel or query.
See Also /help ircII programming for this. Also the ';' has a new
meaning as command seperator within ALIAS, BIND and ON. You might have
to \escape it.

> The good news: Scripts are much more readable and understandable, look
a lot less ugly now  :)   COMMAND_MODE gives command-oriented freaks the
chance to use ircII that way. A special script for MUDders has been added
that emulates an Aber/LPMUD-like environment on irc, without having to
type / before "smile" and allowing "'<text>" for "say" etc.

> CTCP ACTION has been implemented which permits you to send descriptions
of actions/'feelings' to other people on channels and even through
queries.  You can use it with /me and the action script.

@node NEWUSER "Some basics for newusers"

		NEW USER INFORMATION FOR IRC

This file contains some caveats for people new to IRC. It is not a
guide to commands for IRC. For a brief guide to commands for new
users, see /HELP INTRO.

See /HELP @{" ETIQUETTE " link ETIQUETTE } for a guide to good manners on IRC.

IRC is an international network servicing 20 or more countries. There
are over 2000 registered users, and a similar number of regular
unregistered users. Do not expect everybody to speak English.

The primary means of identification is currently by nickname. This can
be modified with / @{" NICK " link NICK } , and registered with NickServ. (/MSG NickServ HELP
for information on NickServ). Note, however that some nicknames are
duplicated, and some people will impersonate others by using their
nicknames. If you have any doubts about the identity of somebody using
a given nick, use / @{" WHOIS " link WHOIS } NickName to find out more. This gives detailed
information on the person using the NickName. For example, if you
are getting abusive messages from "Fred", type:

/WHOIS Fred

If the information displayed is not the same as that which you would
expect for Fred, it is probably a case of impersonation.

Recently some users have been tricking others into allowing them to
control their IRC sessions or damaging their files. If somebody asks
you to type a command and you don't know what it does, use
/HELP CommandName to find out more about it first. In particular,
/ON has been used to cause trouble and is now initially disabled
for new users. Additionally, /QUI is short for /QUIT and will
terminate your IRC session. If you see any message asking you to
type /QUI or /QUIT, ignore it.

Some new users have been baffled by "CTCP" messages appearing on
the IRC session. These are messages from other users, asking your
client to perform some service for them. They are generally
generated by somebody typing in a CTCP command. See /HELP @{" CTCP " link CTCP } .

If you have not already done so, read the HELP files INTRO and
@{" ETIQUETTE " link ETIQUETTE } .

@endnode

@node NICK "Changes your nickname"
Usage: NICK <nickname>
  Changes your nickname to whatever you like.   The nickname may be at
  most 9 characters.  If you specify a nickname that is already in
  use, you will be prompted to enter a new nickname.

@endnode

@node NOTICE "Sends a private message to a user or a channel"
Usage: NOTICE <nicknames|<channel>|-CHANNEL <nickname>> <text of message>
  Sends a private message to the nicknames or list of nicknames
  specified.  Unlike MSG, no automated response messages (such as
  generated by INGORE or an automaton) will be sent in response
  to a NOTICE.  Other than that, it's just like a MSG.

  For a description of parameters and switches see:
    @{" MSG " link MSG }
@endnode

@node NOTIFY "Give Message when a notified user leaves/enters IRC"
Usage: NOTIFY [-]<nickname> { [-]<nickname> ... }
  Use of this command lets you mark certain nicknames such that
  you will be warned when they signon or off of IRC.  When
  someone on your notify-list signs on, you will see a message
  "Signon by <nickname> detected".  Likewise, when they signoff,
  you will see "Signoff by <nickname> detected".  Someone will be
  shown as signed off if they change nicknames as well, so keep
  this in mind.

  You can modify how the signon and signoff messages are
  displayed using the ON NOTIFY_SIGNON and ON NOTIFY_SIGNOFF
  commands.

  Specifying a - before a nickname will remove notification
  checking for that nickname.  If no parameters are specified,
  the current status of each user on your notify list is
  displayed.  If you specify a + without any additional
  parameters:
    /NOTIFY +
  you will be shown a list of only those people on your
  notification list who are currently on irc.
@endnode

@node OPER "Gives you Operator-Priviledges (Operator-Command)"
Usage: OPER <nickname> <password>
  Gives you operator priviledges if the correct nickname and
  password are given.  If password is not given, you will be
  prompted for one.  If no nickname is given, your current
  nickname will be used.
@endnode

@node PART "Leave a channel"
Usage: PART <channel>
  Leave a channel.  This is used to leave from a # channel while 
  remaining on all other channels you are on.  Of course, you can
  use PART to leave from any channel, not only # channels.
@endnode

@node QUERY "Start a conversation with a user"
Usage: QUERY [nicknames|%n]
  Starts a private conversation with [nicknames].  All text you
  type that would normally be sent to your channel now goes to
  [nicknames] in the form of MSGs.  To cancel a private
  conversation, use QUERY with no arguments.  The %n arguments
  allows you to send the query text to a process number n.  The
  process must have already been started using a previous call
  to EXEC.  

  See Also:
    @{" EXEC " link EXEC }
@endnode

@node QUIT "Exit IRC"
Usage: QUIT
  Quits your IRC session.
  @{" BYE " link BYE } @{" EXIT " link EXIT } and @{" SIGNOFF " link SIGNOFF } are identical.
@endnode

@node QUOTE "Sends a command directly to your server"
Usage: QUOTE <server command>
  Send a command directly to the server.  No parsing is done by
  the client.
@endnode

@node REDIRECT "Send output from a command to a nickname/channel/process"
Usage: REDIRECT <nick|channel|process> <cmd>
  This will send the output from the given command to the
  specified nickname, channel, or started process.  For 
  example: 
    /REDIRECT +Har /whois bigcheese
  This sends the result of "/whois bigcheese" to channel +Har.  
  There is an implicit WAIT built into the REDIRECT command.
  This means that all output will be redirected until the
  given command has finished executing.  This can have some
  unpredictable results, so use it with caution.
@endnode

@node REHASH "Let the server re-read its configuration file (Operator-Command)"
Usage: REHASH
  Forces the server to re-read its configuration file.
@endnode

@node RESTART "Restart the server (Operator-Command)"
Usage: RESTART
  Causes your server to restart itself, or more correctly, to start up
  the binary with the path you have defined in the ircd's config.h.

@endnode

@node RULES "Some basics for newusers"

Definitions:

   IRC-ADMIN - Person who have access to all files concerning ircd.
   IRC-OP    - Person who have privilegies given to him by an IRC-ADMIN.
               And who is in charge at HIS server.
   USER      - Person who is using IRC.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

            Users Behavior on the Internet Relay Chat system



The Internet Relay Network (IRC) is a system for comunicating with other
peopples.

IRC is a free speech system. Users may exchange viewpoints with other
users. But to protect people from abuse there are certain rules that the 
user MUST respect.

If a USER doesn't respect the guidelines/rules stated below, then the
IRC-ADMIN may suspend or reduce the availability for the USER.

These things are prohibited:

   * Using offensive words in channel topics.
    
   * Harassing another user. Harassment is defined as behavior towards 
     another user with the purpose of annoying them. 
     Harassment is a matter of opinion of the IRC-OP.

   * "Dumping" a lot of text to a channel.

   * Annoying another user or a channel with constant beeping. 

   * Any behavior reducing the functionality of IRC.

What kind of action a user is doing to break these rules are up to the 
IRC-OP to decide.

Violation should be straighted out via a civilized conversation between
the IRC-OP and the USER.
If the USER is not on-line then the USER should be notified by EMail.
If the USER wont respect what he's been told then it is up to the IRC-ADMIN 
what to do with the USER.


If someone finds a USER violating these rules he may contact the USER's
IRC-ADMIN.
To find a USERS IRC-ADMIN one may use the / @{" ADMIN " link ADMIN } <nick-name>.

@endnode

@node SAVE "Save currently IRC-Settings to a file"
Usage: SAVE [filename]
  This will save all of the settings of IRCII to a file.  It
  saves all of the Key Bindings, Variables, and Aliases (in that
  order) in a format such that they can be loaded into IRCII
  using the LOAD command or the -l switch.  If no filename is
  given, the your default .ircrc file will be used (unless
  changed with the -l switch).

  See Also:
    @{" LOAD " link LOAD }
    @{" IRCII COMMAND_LINE_ARGS " link ARGUMENTS }
@endnode

@node SAY "Send a message to the current channel"
Usage: SAY <text>

    This command is to permit aliases, binds, scripts and similar to send
a message to the current channel as if it were typed. This is equivalent
to typing '/ <text>'.

   See Also:
    @{" SEND " link SEND }
    @{" IRCII PROGRAMMING " link PROGRAM }
@endnode

@node SEND "Send a message to the current channel"
Usage: SEND <text>

    This command is to permit aliases, binds, scripts and similar to send
a message to the current channel or query as if it were typed.

  See Also:
    @{" SAY " link SAY }
    @{" IRCII PROGRAMMING " link PROGRAM }
@endnode

@node SERVER "Changes your server"
Usage: SERVER [+|-][<name of server>|<number in server_list>] [port number]

  Switches your primary server to the server specified at the
  specified port number.   If no port nunmber is given, the default
  port number is used.   Your channel and AWAY status will remain
  unchanged.   Occasionally, you can switch servers faster than the
  irc   network can send out the information that you have left a
  server.  So don't be suprised if it says your nickname is in 
  use...  just wait a moment and set it with @{" NICK " link NICK } .  IRCII
  maintains an internal list of servers you have connected to.
  To see that list, use /SERVER with no arguments.  You may also
  specify one of the servers in the server list by its number in
  the list, by issuing:
    /SERVER <number in list>
  Likewise, you can automatically switch to the next or previous
  server in the server list by doing:
    /SERVER + 
  or 
    /SERVER - 
  to switch to the next and previous server in the list,
  respectively.  
  Also, you can set a particular server to be associated with a
  particular IRCII window.  To do this, set the current window to the
  window you wish to use and do:
    /SERVER +servername
  In this case, servername may again be a name, IP address, or number
  of a server in your server list.
  This will connect you to the given server as a secondary server in
  that window.  Doing a /SERVER with no parameters will show you your
  primary server.  If you kill the last window associated with a
  server, the connection to that server will close.  If you kill the
  last window associated with your primary server, a new open server
  will be chosen as the primary server.  If there are open servers you
  will not be allowed to close the connection to your primary server.
  The following will also close a connection to a specific server:
    /SERVER -servername
  When you create new windows, they will use as their associated
  server whatever was the server for the current window when the new
  window was created.  You can therefore have more than one window for
  any server, but still only one primary server.

  Every time you switch to a new server, it gets
  added to the server list automatically.  To set up initial
  servers in the server list, you can specify them on the command
  line as such:
    irc <nickname> server1 server2 server3
  Each host may have it's own ort(number and passuord specifigd
  on the command line as well:
    irc <nickname> server1:6667 server2:7000:blah server3::foo  In this case, smrter1 will usm zopt 6667, server2 will use port
  7000 with password blah, and server3 will use the default port
  number with password foo.  The -p switch on the command line
  allows you to specify the default port number.  Also, if no
  password is specified and one is needed to connect, you will be
  prompted to enter a password before you can connect.  You can
  also specify the default server list in the IRCSERVER
  environment variable using the same format as above.

@endnode

@node SIGNOFF "Exit IRC"
Usage: SIGNOFF
  Quits your IRC session.
  @{" BYE " link BYE } @{" EXIT " link EXIT } and @{" QUIT " link SIGNOFF } are identical.
@endnode

@node SLEEP "Suspend IRC for the given number of seconds"
Usage: SLEEP <number of seconds>
  This suspends IRCII for the number of seconds given.  NOTHING happens
  during this time.  This is really only useful for automatons.
  Maybe not even then.
@endnode

@node SQUIT "Sends a server quit to the named server (Operator-Command)"
Usage: SQUIT <servername>
  Sends a server quit to the named server.
@endnode

@node STATS "Shows some stats about IRC"
Usage: STATS [L|C]
  Shows some irc server usage statistics.  If L is specified,
  more specific information is displayed on the current irc
  server connections.  If C is specified, the server's connections
  as specified in it's config file are displayed.
@endnode

@node SUMMON "Summons a user to IRC"
Usage: SUMMON <userid>[@server]
  Summons a user to irc.  The user currently must be logged into
  the server machine for this to function.

@endnode

@node TIME "Shows time/date"
Usage: TIME [server]
  Shows the current time of day and date.  If a server is
  specified, the time of day and date are reported from that
  server.  @{" DATE " link DATE } and TIME are identical.
@endnode

@node TOPIC "Changes the topic"
Usage: TOPIC [<channel>] [<topic for channel>]
  Changes the topic for the named channel.
@endnode

@node TRACE "Shows the server connection of a server"
Usage: TRACE <server>
  Shows the server connection of the given server.  
@endnode

@node TYPE "Simulate keyboard keystrokes"
Usage: TYPE <keystrokes>
  The TYPE command simulates keyboard keystrokes.  You can
  include control characters as well as normal characters and
  they will respond as they would as if typed at the keyboard.
  A control key is specified by a ^ before the letter.  For
  example:
    TYPE Testing^B^B^B go^E
  will type the word "Testing", move the cursor left three
  spaces, then type " go" and move the cursor to the end of the
  line,  leaving "Test going" on the input line.  This will
  probably happen too fast to see.  
@endnode

@node USERS "Shows the user logged into a server"
Usage: USERS <server>
  Shows the users logged into the machine where the specified
  server is running.  If no server is given, the current server
  is used.
@endnode

@node VERSION "Shows the IRC II version number of client and server"
Usage: VERSION [server]
  Shows the IRCII version number and the version number of the
  server specifed.  If no server name is specifed, the version
  of your current server is shown.
@endnode

@node WAIT "Wait for something"
Usage: WAIT [%process]
  There are two forms of this command.  The first is:
    /WAIT
  with no arguments.  This form waits for all server output to finish
  before continuing.  This is useful if you have an alias in which you
  change a variable that you wish to change back after completion of
  the command, or if you wish to insure that your operator privs are
  activated in your .ircrc before continuing: For example, in your
  .ircrc:
    /OPER <nick> <password>
    /WAIT
    /TRACE
  The /WAIT insures that the server has responded to the /OPER before
  continuing.  If you didn't /WAIT, you would get an Unknown command
  error from the /TRACE.

  The second form of the command is:
    /WAIT %process
  Where %process is a valid running processes id or name.  This is
  used to cause IRCII to wait for an EXECd process to finish before
  continuing.  If the given process doesn't exist, return is
  immediate. Here is an example of it's use:
    /on ^exec uptime /assign uptime $1
    /on ^exec_exit uptime
    /alias uptime /exec -name uptime uptime\\n/wait %uptime
  Now, whenever you do /uptime, this runs the uptime program and
  ASSIGNs the uptime variable to the time of day (that's $1 in the
  return from uptime).  This can be used for things like:
    /alias dotime /uptime\\nThe time is: ${uptime}
  which will send "The time is: 10:42pm" to your channel (with the
  correct time of course).
@endnode

@node WALL "Sends a message to all users on IRC"
Usage: WALL <text of message>
  Sends a message to all users on irc.  
@endnode

@node WALLOPS "Sends a message to all operators currently on IRC"
Usage: WALLOPS <message>
  Sends a message to all operators currently on irc.
@endnode

@node WHILE "A While-command"
Usage: WHILE boolean cmd
  This will execute the given cmd while the given boolean returns
  true.  The boolean has the same format as for the @{" IF " link IF } command, except
  that it is re-evaluated at each loop interation.  The same is true
  for cmd.  It is re-evaluated at each loop interation.  This mean
  that if you have a $ ex ression that yo wish to test aT each loop
  inDeration you must put two $.  This is because the first $ will be
  consumed whe the command is initially parse, and the seconD will
  be done at each loop interation.  For example:
    /alias repeat /^assign blah 0\\n/while "$${blah}<$0" "$^"^$1-\\\\n/^assign blah $${blah+1}"\\n/^assign -blah
  This can be used as follows:
    /repeat 10 /msg bigcheese This repeats 10 times
  The repeat alias is broken down into three parts (between \\n's):
    /^assign blah 0
    /while "$${blah}<$0" "$^"^$1-\\\\n/^assign blah $${blah+1}"
    /^assign -blah
  The first is to initialize blah to 0 and the last part is to remove
  blah when done.  The WHILE portion is described below:
  The boolean for the while loop is "$${blah}<$0".  When the
  alias is first parsed, this is becomes "${blah}<10" using the above
  example.  This is what is then used at each loop interation.  At the
  first iteration this will be "0<10",  at the next "1<10", and so on.
  The cmd part of this looks like "$^"^$1-\\\\n/^assign blah $${blah+1}"   
  When the alias is first parsed, this becomes 
      "/msg bigcheese This repeats 10 times\\n/^assign blah ${blah+1}"
  This is executed at each loop interation.  It sends the MSG to
  BigCheese and then it increments blah by 1.  

  I hope this clears things up for you.  It gets a bit confusing
  knowing when to put two $ and when not to.  Just remember that each
  alias is parsed once through before the sub-command parts are
  evaluated.  The WHILE command then uses that and evaluates again the
  boolean and cmd portions of the WHILE.

@endnode

@node WHO "Gives a listing of the users on IRC"
Usage: WHO [-switch [arg]] [wildcard expression]
  Gives a listing of the users on irc.  If no flags are
  specified, the wildcard expression you supply will 
  match any field returned by WHO.  However, if the wildcard
  expression is "*" (an asterisk), the users on the current
  channel are shown.  If the expression is 0, all users on irc are 
  shown.  The following switches are also recognized and used
  to limit the listing:

    -OPERATORS            - lists only operators
    -CHOPS		  - lists only channel operators
    -NAME <username>      - lists only people with matching 
                            user-ids
    -FILE <filename>      - lists only people listed in the
			    file

  The switches may be abbreviated unambiguously.  All matching of
  usernames, hostnames, and servernames may contain wildcards (*).
  Wildcards in the form "*.edu" are also correctly recognized
  by the IRC server (so there's no need for ircII to do that).
@endnode

@node WHOIS "Shows more informations about a user"
Usage: WHOIS <nickname>
       WHOIS <nick1>,<nick2> [...]
       WHOIS <server> <nickname>[,<nick2>...]

  Shows more detailed information about the nickname specified.
  This info includes the users name, host, server, "real" name,
  and away message.  As you can see in the second line you can
  use /whois on multiple nicknames. The third line demonstrates
  how you can send the /whois request to a distant server. If
  you /whois a person on his server you will receive extra info
  about his idle time.

  See Also:
    @{" WHOWAS " link WHOWAS }

@node WHOWAS "Shows information about who userd the given nickname last"
Usage: WHOWAS <nickname>
  Shows information about who used the given nickname last, even
  if no one is currently using it.
@endnode

@node WINDOW "Manipulate/open/close windows in IRC II"
Usage: WINDOW [<argument> [<argument> <argument> ...]]
  The WINDOW command lets you manipulate multiple "windows" in
  IRCII.  Windows are horizontally divided sections of the
  screen in which different bits of irc information can be
  displayed.  WINDOW lets you create, manipulate, and remove
  such windows.  The <argument> parameter to WINDOW can be one
  of the following:
    NEW            Creates a new window by splitting the current
                   window evenly.  
    KILL           Removes the current window.  This does not
                   remove you from any channel you were on in that
                   window.
    GOTO n         Set the current window to the n'th window visible 
                   on the screen.  They are numbered from the 1 being 
                   the topmost window.
    GROW <n>       Increases the size of the current window by n
                   lines.
    SHRINK <n>     Decreases the size of the current window by n
                   lines.
    CHANNEL <c>    Directs all conversation with channel <c> to the
                   current window.  If you are not current on
                   channel <c>, you will join it.  If you are on
                   channel <c> it will be diverted to the current
                   window, possibly removing channel <c> from
                   another window.
    BALANCE        Causes all windows to resize so they are as
                   close as possible to evenly sized.
    SCROLL <f>     Where <f> is ON, OFF, or TOGGLE.  This controls
                   scrolling for the current window.  
    HOLD_MODE <f>  Where <f> is ON, OFF, or TOGGLE.  This
                   controls hold mode for the current window.
    LEVEL <L>      Where <L> is a comma separated list of one of
                   the following: CRAP, PUBLIC, MSG, NOTICE,
                   WALL, WALLOP, NOTE, ALL, or NONE.  This controls 
                   what types of messages will go to the current
                   window.
    LOG <f>        Where <f> is ON, OFF, or TOGGLE.  This turns on
                   logging for the current window only.  The logfile
                   name is created from the current setting of the
                   LOGFILE variable and the name of the window channel,
                   query user, or simply the word "Window" with the
                   windows internal reference number aadded to the end.
                   For example, if LOGFILE is set to "IrcLog", and you
                   are on channel "+Har", the log file for the window 
                   will be "IrcLog.+Har".  
    NAME s         Sets the "name" for the window to s.  This name may 
                   now be used in place of the refnum assigned by IRCII
    PROMPT s       Sets the input prompt for the window.  It will replace 
                   $T as the window target when used in the INPUT_PROMPT 
                   variable.  The window prompt is set automatically when 
                   EXEC detects	a prompt from a process.
    NOTIFY         Toggles notification for the current window when it is
                   invisible. If set to ON, the first text written to the
                   window after it is hidden will cause a line to be
                   displayed in the current window at that time.
    BACK           Set the current window to the previous current window
    MOVE n         Moves the current window n positions on the screen.  
                   MOVE 1 will move the current window down 1 on the screen.
	       	   Window proportions are maintained using MOVE
    REFNUM r	   Change the current window to the window with refnum r
    HIDE 	   Make the current window "hidden".  It still exists in 
		   every way except it takes up no space on the screen.
    SHOW r	   Makes the hidden window with refnum r visible again and make 
		   it the current window.  If the window is already visible,
		   just make it the current window.
    SWAP r         Swaps the current window with the hidden window with refnum r.
		   The proportions of the window are maintained.
    ADD n    	   Adds n to window namelist, where n is either a nick or
		   channel name.  All communcation with n will go to that window.
		   Also, n may be a comma separated list (no spaces).
    LIST	   Show a list of all windows.
    PUSH	   Push the current window onto the window stack.
    POP		   Pop the top window off the window stack making it the current
		   window.  If it is hidden, the make it visible first.
    STACK	   Show all the windows in the window stack.
    HIDE_OTHERS	   This hides all visible windows but the current window.
    KILL_OTHERS    This kills all visible windows but the current window.
    LASTLOG_LEVEL <L>  Where <L> is the same as for LEVEL, this
                       controls what types of messages displayed
                       in the current window should be saved to
                       the windows lastlog.
    SERVER <s:n:p> This allows you to specify a different server to
                   connect to for the current window.  The <s:n:p>
                   refers to the servername, portnumber, and password.
                   The portnum and password are optional.  If you are
                   already connected to the specified server, the
                   window will switch to that server.  Doing a /WINDOW
                   with no parameters shows you what server is
                   associated with it.  See HELP SERVER for more about
                   this.  

  The <L> parameters for LEVEL and LASTLOG_LEVEL are described
  more fully in SET LASTLOG_LEVEL.

  The settings of the system variables @{" SCROLL " link SETSCROLL } and @{" HOLD_MODE " link SETHOLD_MODE } are
  used as defaults for new windows created.  Executing a 
  SET SCROLL or SET HOLD_MODE will change the settings for the
  current window as well.

  The "current window" is denoted by "^^^^^^^^^^" in the status
  line for that window.   You can switch the current window by
  activating the key functions @{" PREVIOUS_WINDOW " link BPREVIOUS_WINDO } or @{" NEXT_WINDOW " link BNEXT_WINDOW } .
  These are bound, by default, to ^Xp and ^Xn, respectively.

  Each window can have the conversation of a channel going to
  it, which can be specified by either using WINDOW CHANNEL <c>
  or by executing the @{" JOIN " link JOIN } or @{" CHANNEL " link CHANNEL } commands in a window.
  Each window can also have it's own @{" QUERY " link QUERY } user.  When QUERYing
  someone in a window, all conversation with that person is
  directed to that window.

  No information is ever lost.  Anything that doesn't otherwise
  have a specific window to go to (because it is a window's
  current channel or QUERY user) will either go to the current
  window, or the window who's LEVEL setting contains an
  appropriate type for that message.  By default, the first
  window created has a LEVEL of ALL, meaning that all messages
  will go to that window unless otherwise specified.  This
  includes all output from NAMES, LIST, WHO, etc.  These things
  fall under the CRAP category for LEVEL.  If you want, for
  example, these messages to go to your current window, you can
  do this in the original window:
    WINDOW LEVEL ALL,-CRAP
  Now, all "crap" will go to your current window, while all
  private messages, walls, wallops, mail, and notices will go to
  the root window.
@endnode

@node XECHO "Output a given text"
Usage: XECHO [flags] <text>
  XECHO is like @{" ECHO " link ECHO } , except that it takes flag arguments.

Flags:
  -LEVEL <level>  displays the message with the specified lastlog

@node ALIAS "Sets an alias"
@TOC ALIASGR
Usage: ALIAS [-][alias] [commands]
  Creates a command alias for [commands].  Commands do not need to be
  prefixed with a command character, in fact they shouldn't!
  If you want an alias to type something to the channel or query
  use SEND or SAY. You can use ';' to put multiple commands in a row.

  Special character sequences, usually ircII variables, are prefixed
  with '$'.  There are certain $ sequences built in to IRCII for getting
  such information as your nickname and current channel, plus you can
  expand your own variables and system variables using the $ format.  
  You can also expand functions, substituting their return values.
  See ASSIGN for more on this.

  Here are some simple alias examples:
    /ALIAS HELLO MSG $0 Hello, $0! $1-
  This alias can be used by typing:
    /HELLO BigCheese How are you?
  This would act as though you had typed:
    /MSG BigCheese Hello, BigCheese! How are you?
  ALIAS with just the [alias] argument shows the current alias
  for that word.  ALIAS with no argument shows all current
  aliases.  To remove an alias, use ALIAS -[alias].

  To use more than one command in an alias, seperate them by \\n.  

  For more specific information about the $ uses and more examples,
  see the specific help files listed below.

@node FUNCTIONS "Alias/IRC II-functions"
@TOC ALIASGR
IRCII Functions
  IRCII functions are substituted with the format $%FUNCTION(arguments).
  A function is an ALIAS which assigns a value to FUNCTION_RETURN.
  For example:
        /ALIAS DOUBLE assign FUNCTION_RETURN $({$0+$0})
        /ALIAS SHOWDOUBLE echo $%DOUBLE($0)
  will cause
        /SHOWDOUBLE 7
  to display "14".

  The following built-in functions already exist and cannot be overriden:
  LEFT(COUNT STRING)    Returns the COUNT leftmost bytes from the STRING.
  RIGHT(COUNT STRING)   Returns the COUNT rightmmost bytes from the STRING.
  MID(INDEX COUNT STRING) Returns COUNT bytes starting at position INDEX
                        in STRING.
  INDEX(CHARLIST STRING) Returns the index to the first character in STRING
                        which appears in CHARLIST.
  RINDEX(CHARLIST STRING) Returns the index to the last character in STRING
			which appears in CHARLIST.
  TIME()                Returns the current system time as a long integer
  STIME(TIMEVAL)        Returns the date and time in English that corresponds
                        to the long integer TIMEVAL.
  RAND(LIMIT)           Returns a random number x such that 0<=x<LIMIT
  SRAND(SEED)           Seeds the random number generator and returns nothing.
                        The seed may be a long integer, although only the low
                        integer is used.

NOTE The argument separator for functions is the space character, not the
     comma.

@node AQUOTE "Quoting modifier"
@TOC ALIASGR
ALIAS MODIFIER:
  This is a special quoting modifier.  Use of this modifier tells
  IRCII that you wish certain characters in the converted text to be
  quoted using the \ character.  The form of this modifier is:
    $^c<sequence>
  where c is the character to be quoted, and <sequence> is one of the
  special sequences.  For example, you may wish to do the following:
    /alias foo /if 1 "/echo $^"*"
  and you do:
    /foo "This is a Test"
  Since $ expressions are parsed first, the $^"* is the first thing
  parsed.  The ^" part tells IRCII to quote and " in the resultant
  string.  So, the $^"* is expanded just like $* and becomes:
    "This is a Test"
  and the ^" causes it to quote all ", which becomes:
    \"This is a Test\"
  This is then replaced in the original alias for parsing, so /foo
  becomes:
    /if 1 "/echo \"This is a test\""
  Notice that the \" won't interfere with the parsing of the " in the
  IF statement.  
  The ^ modifier must be first after the $.  You may specify more than
  one character to be quoted simply be adding more ^c to the
  expression:
    $^"^'B
  will quote all occurences of " and ' in the body of the last message
  you received.

  Remember, you can use both forms of modifiers, but they must be in
  the correct order.  All ^ modifiers must be first, followed by any
  [] modifier.  For example:
    $^.[-10]S
  This will right justify your server name and quote any . in the
  server name with \.

@node SPECIAL "Special character sequences for ALIAS"
@TOC ALIASGR
Special character sequences for ALIAS:
  All special character sequences begin with a $.  In their simpliest
  form, the following have special meaning in aliases:
    $*   Expands to the rest of the arguments on the command line.
    $n   Where n is a non-negative number, expands to the nth arg.
    $n-m Where n and m are non-negative numbers, expands to the
         nth thru mth arguments inclusive.
    $n-  Where n is a non-negative number, expands from the nth
         argument to the end of the argument list.
    $-m  Where m is a non-negative number, expands from the
         beginning of the argument list to the mth argument.
         This is the same as $0-m.
    $,   Expands to the nickname of the last person who send you 
         a /MSG
    $.   Expands to the nickname of the last person to whom you 
         sent a /MSG
    $variable  Expands to the value of one of the following:
           1) Matching ASSIGN'd variable
           2) Matching IRCII SET variable
           3) Matching environment variable
           4) Nothing
         It checks in the order shown.  Thus, if 1 doesn't match, 2 is
         tried.  If 2 doesn't match, 3 is tried, etc.
         See ASSIGN for more details.
    $"Prompt"  Will prompt you (using the text between the double 
               quotes) for input which will be replaced in the 
               alias.
    $(sub-alias)  This expands out the sub-aliases, then uses that
         result in place of the (sub-alias) expression.  For example
         $($0) will first expand $0... suppose it expands to S.  Then
         it replaces that in the original text, giving you $S, which
         is then expanded to the name of your current server.
    $!history!  This expands to a matching entry in your command
         history.  The text between the ! may contain wildcards.
    $:   Expands to the nickname of the last person to join your 
         channel
    $;   Expands to the nickname of the last person to send a public
         message to your channel
    $A   Expands to the text of your AWAY message
    $B   Expands to the body of the last MSG you sent.
    $S   Expands to the name of your server
    $Q   Expands to the nickname of the person you are QUERYing.
    $C   Expands to your current channel
    $T   Expands to the 'target' of your input (either a QUERY nick or
         a current channel)
    $N   Expands to your nickname
    $K   Expands to the current value of CMDCHAR.  Useful to have 
         aliases work even when you change CMDCHAR.
    $I   Expands to the name of the channel to which you were last
         INVITED
    $S   Expands to the name of the server you are on
    $L   Expands to the current contents of the input line
    $Z   Expands to the time of day
    $A   Expands to your current AWAY message
*    $O   Expands to the value of STATUS_OPER if you are currently an operator
    $P   Expands to "@" if you are a chanop on the current channel
    $D   Expands to the nickname of the person whose sign-on was last
         detected by the NOTIFY mechanism.
    $$   Expands to $

  Argument to aliases will automatically be appended to the expanded
  alias unless you use one of the following forms in the alias:
     $*
     $n
     $n-m
     $-m
     $n-
     $(sub-alias)
  If one of these forms is used in the alias arguments are not appended.
  For example: 
    /ALIAS M /MSG
  will be treated as:      
    /ALIAS M /MSG $*
  However,
    /ALIAS M /MSG $0 $1-
  will not have the arguments appended.  If you have an alias and you wish to 
  prevent arguments from being appended, add $() to the alias.  The $() with
  nothing between the parenthesis expands to nothing and prevents arguments
  from being appended.

  Any alias may be surrounded by {}s so that it can be imbedded within
  another string.  For example:
    a${N}a
  will expand to (assuming your nickname is BigCheese):
    aBigCheesea
  Aliases are automatically delimited by certain characters.  For example:
    "$N"
  expands to:
    "BigCheese"
@endnode

@node WIDTH "Width-modifier"
@TOC ALIASGR
ALIAS MODIFIER:
  This modifier is a width specifier for any of the forms of
  alias.  This is done by placing [<width>] after the $ (and
  after and ^c expressions).  For example:
    $[10]C
  This expand to your current channel, but it will truncate any
  characters beyond 10 in the channel name.  If the channel is
  less than 10 characters, it will be padded on the right with
  blanks.  Specifying a negative width will justify the field on
  the right and pad on the left with blanks.  A width of 0 is
  treated as though no width specifier was used.  If you get real
  tricky, you can do things like this:
    $([$CHANNEL_NAME_WIDTHD]C)
  The value of the IRCII variable CHANNEL_NAME_WIDTH will be expanded
  in the $() expression.   If CHANNEL_NAME_WIDTH is 10, this will result
  in $[10]C which will then expand as described above.
 
  Remember, you can use both forms of modifiers, but they must be in
  the correct order.  All ^ modifiers must be first, followed by any
  [] modifier.  For example:
    $^.[-10]S
  This will right justify your server name and quote any . in the
  server name with \.

@node BMETA1_CHARACTE "Set META1-character"
@TOC BINDGR
Usage: BIND <key> META1_CHARACTER
  This function switches to an "alternate" keymap.  That is,
  after this character is hit, the next key hit can have a new
  definition.  This is how the Escape sequences are done.  In
  fact, the escape key's default binding is META1_CHARACTER.  For
  example:
    BIND ^X META1_CHARACTER

  The PARSE_COMMAND function cause the supplied string to be
  executed as an ircII command (or alias). It doesn't need to be
  prefixed by the command character. This function does not disturb
  the contents of the input line and is not added to the command history.
  You may also include any of the special $ sequences available in ALIAS

@TOC BINDGR
Usage: BIND <key> QUOTE_CHARACTER
  This function "quotes" the next key hit.  What this really
  means is that it overrides the key binding for the next key and
  forces it to insert itself into the input buffer.  For example,
  if you have Control D bound to delete character, and you hit
  the quote character (defaults to Control Q) then Control D, it
  will insert a Control D (shows up as an inverse video D) and
  does not delete the character.  Got it?

  numbers, etc.  If this is bound to a meta sequence, it will
  only insert the last key hit in the meta sequence.
@endnode

@node BSEND_LINE "Send line"
@TOC BINDGR
Usage: BIND <key> SEND_LINE
  This "sends" the input buffer to the server.  Well, really it

Here are some examples of the BIND function:
    /BIND ^X META2_CHARACTER
  Makes control X a meta key.
    /BIND ^Xl parse LIST
  Binds the meta sequence control X followed by l to perform a
  /LIST.  This binding is only valid if ^X was previously bound
  to a meta function (as was done in the first example).
    /BIND META1-u BACKWARD_HISTORY
  by default, the escape key is bound to META1_CHARACTER, so this
  binding makes the escape u key sequence show the last command
  history entry.  Note that more than one key may be bound to
  *any* function.
    /BIND ! type Bang!
  This binds the !  (exclamation mark) to type the word "Bang!"

@TOC CTCPGR
Usage: CTCP <nickname> <command> [args]
  CTCP allows you access to the client-to-client protocol used

  clients on the network.  The CTCP mechanism works by sending
  a specially coded message to another user whose client is
  supposed to reply with a reply message of the type, or with
  an error message, unless you sent it to a channel.

  For example, if you do:
	/CTCP BigCheese VERSION	
  you will receive:
	*** CTCP REPLY VERSION from BigCheese: IRCII 2.1 Unix

  The <command> field may be of several types, new ones are
  introduced all the time, but there is a mechanism for you to

@node ARGUMENTS "IRC II - Arguments"
@TOC IRCIIGR
The command line arguments to IRCII ar as follows:

irc [nick [server list]] [switches]

You may specify a nickname, which will supersede the IRCNICK
environment variable.  The server list will be added to the
server list found in the IRCSERVER variable.  However, the 
servers specified on the command line will appear first in the
server list and be the first to which connections are attempted.
See IRCII SERVER_LISTS for the format of a server list.

The [switches]:
   -c <channel> joins <channel> at startup.  If not specified, you
                start at channel 0.
   -p <port>    default server connection port (usually 6667).
                This default port number can be over-riden by
                specifying a port number in the server list (see below) 
                or using the SERVER command (see SERVER).
   -f           your terminal uses flow controls (^S/^Q), so IRCII shouldn't
                You may want to rebind ^Q and ^S so you can still
                use those functions.  ^Q is usually bound to
                QUOTE_CHARACTER, and ^S is usually bound to
                TOGGLE_STOP_SCREEN.  See BIND about this.
   -F           your terminal doesn't use flow control (default).
                Opposite of -f, forces IRCII to take over ^Q/^S.
   -s           Start IRCII without using the server process (ircserv)
                even if it can find it.  This is useful for use with
                irciid and automatons which don't need the
                separate process (since they never ^Z).
   -d           runs IRCII in "dumb" terminal mode.  IRCII then 
                uses no fancy screen stuff or fancy input editting.
                All output goes to stout, and all input is read from
                stdin.  Input editting is only done by your tty (if any).
                No IRCII keybinding Have any effect In dumb mode.
   -l <file>    loads <file> in place of your .ircrc
   -a           adds default servers and command line servers to server 
                list.  Normally, if you specify servers on the command
                line, the IRCSERVER and default server are not added to the
                server list.  This forces all servers known to be added.
                The order in which servers appear in you server list 
                are as follows:
                   1. command line servers (from left to right)
                   2. IRCSERVER servers (from left to right)
                   3. Default IRCII servers
   -b           runs IRCII in dumb mode but accepts no user input.
                This is useful for automatons written totally under
                IRCII which you wish to run in the background.  IRCII
                will automatically fork into the background with
                this switch (unless -n is used).
   -n           Prevents IRCII from forking into the background with
                either the -b or -e switches..
   -e <process arg list>  runs IRCII by reading stdin from <process> and
                sending stdout to <process>.  All other args are passed 
                to <process>,  so this must be the last switch.  IRCII
                will fork into the background unless -n is used.

@node IRCII "About IRC II..."
@TOC IRCIIGR
IRCII is a termcap based interface to the IRC Network.  All
commands to IRCII begin with a '/' (or whatever your current
CMDCHAR is set to, see HELP SET CMDCHAR).  Any otheb text you
type on the command line is sent directly to the channel you are
on.

IRCII may be ftp'ed from plod.cbme.unsw.oz.au [129.94.128.121]

@node PROGRAM "About programming in IRC II"
@TOC IRCIIGR
This is about programming in ircII, because ircII is not a client program,
it's an operating system.. :)  And the language is just as simple as SMAIL
(that is: it is horrendous) but if you want to get into it, here's a little
note for you:

The command character (usually '/') is only necessary when you type commands
interactively, when you program things it is no more needed, it used to be
though. If you want to type to the channel from within an alias, on or
binding, you have to use SAY or SEND.

The ';' has a special meaning in aliases, bindings and ons: It is treated
as command seperator, that means you can execute multiple commands in
a row seperated by semicolons. The semicolons are not considered seperators
when you use them interactively (to be able to type  ;-)) and within an
ircII script file. You can escape the meaning of ; in an alias with \;.

@node SERVLIST "IRC II - Serverlist"
@TOC IRCIIGR
The formats of an IRCII server list is as follows:
  servername
  servername:portnum
  servername:portnum:password
  servername::password
The servername is the name of the server, the portnum is the port
number of that server to connect to, and the password is a
connection password for that server.  The first format above
uses the default port number and no password.  The second format
specifies a port number for connection to the specified server
and no password.  The third format specifies both a port number
and password for connection.  The final format uses a password
and the default port number.

And, since we call these "server lists", you may specify as many
of the above formats as you wish.  These may be used on the IRCII
command line (See HELP IRCII COMMAND_LINE_ARGS) and in the
IRCSERVER environment variable (see HELP IRCII ENVIRONMENT_VARS).
@endnode

@node STATLINE "IRC II - Statusline"
@TOC IRCIIGR
The IRCII status line shows some important pieces of information.
It shows your current nickname (with an asterisk next to it if
you have OPER privs), your current channel and QUERY user (if you
are QUERYing anyone), current Insert or Overwrite mode (I or O),
and your AWAY status.

The status line may be customized using certain IRCII variables.
Please see the following for more information on this:

@node LOAD "Loads a IRC II - script"
Usage: LOAD [-args] <filename> [arg0 arg1 ...]
  Loads the given file into irc, treating each line as an irc
  command, just as if it were typed into the command line, but it
  expects commands to not have leading command characters, for
  compatibility it is however allowed. LOAD is the command used
  automatically at irc startup to load the .ircrc file.

  In a LOAD script it is allowed to have leading spaces and tabs
  before the commands.

  A long line, like a long alias definition, can be split over
  multiple lines by putting { and } around it like this:

alias follow {
  say sorry folks, got invited away
  join -i;bow
  say here i am especially for you
  grin
}

  This format _MUST_ be used, you cannot put the { in the next
  line and you cannot put the } elsewhere than by itself.
  It is also not allowed to use { { } } constructs.

  If the -args flag is specified, then each
  line of the loaded file is alias expanded before it is executed,
  just as if you had INPUT_ALIASES set to ON.  The optional
  arguments, arg0 arg1 etc, are then used to expand the argument
  expandos ($*, $1, $2, etc) for each line.  The -args switch
  takes precedent over any changes of the setting of INPUT_ALIASES
  in the loaded file.  If you only want to expand certain lines
  and not others, use the INPUT_ALIASES variable since it too will
  used the arguments on the command line.

  Commands seperated by ';' are not recognized by LOAD, that syntax
  is for ALIAS, BIND and ON only.

@node ACTION "Some aliases..."
@TOC LOADGR
Usage: /LOAD action

  Several Multi-User-Dungeon-like aliases are defined here.
  They make use of the /me command, and are transmitted to
  the current channel or the current query via CTCP ACTION.
  Old client programs might not understand this kind of
  messages.

  The simple aliases (without arguments) are:
	APPLAUD		BOUNCE		BOW		BURP
	CHUCKLE		CLAP		COUGH		CRY
	GASP		GIGGLE		GRIN		GROAN
	LAUGH		MOAN		NOD		PURR
	SCREAM		SHIVER		SHRUG		SIGH
	SING		SMILE		SNAP		SNEEZE
	SNORE		WAVE		WHISTLE		WIGGLE
	WINK		YAWN

  These instead, require a nickname as argument:
	COMFORT		CUDDLE		DANCE		HUG
	KISS		LOVE		POKE		SHAKE
	SLAP		SPIT		THANK

  You can also make up your own sentences with the /ME or the
  /DESCRIBE command.  e.g. "/ME is hungry." will send 
  "BigCheese is hungry." if you are the big cheese.
@endnode

@node LALIAS "Some aliases..."
@TOC LOADGR
Usage: /LOAD alias
  Aliases defined here are:
  /MA <text>	Send another message to the person you last sent one.
		Same as: /m . <text>
  /MR <text>	Send a reply to the person who last sent you a msg.
		Same as: /m , <text>
  /WA		Show the WHOIS of the person you last sent a message to.
  /IA		Invite the person you last sent a message to.

  /UNALIAS <aliasname>	An alias to unalias an alias ;-)
  /UNSET <variablename>	An alias to unset a set.. huh? :)
  /ALARM <time>		Set the alarm of the clock.
  /CLOCK <on/off>	Switch the clock.

  /NO	= /NOTICE	to avoid collision with /NOTIFY
  /LA	= /LASTLOG	to avoid collision with /LAUGH from ACTION
  /LF	= /SET LOGFILE	for lazy ones.. 
  /"	= /QUOTE	  "       "

  Contributed by various ircers...
  /IGNORELAST		ignore messages and notices from the person that last sent you a msg
  /PROTECT		make your channel invite-only and writeprotected
  /UNPROTECT		remove that state of protection again
  /CHOPS		get a list of the channel operators on the channel
  /WJOIN <channel>	join a channel and open a special window for it
  /TALKTO <target>	open a window and start a query with <target> in it
  /OOPS <right_person>	excuse yourself for a msg that went to the wrong person and send it

@node BASICAL "Some aliases..."
@TOC LOADGR
Usage: /LOAD basical
  Basical aliases are defined here, so to make ircII compatible
  to the old irc. This script should be loaded from the global ircrc.

  However, some additional aliases are defined:

  /CHOP <nick>	    Make a person channel-op of your current channel.
  /K <nick>         Kick person from current channel.
  /MO <modechange>  Make a mode change on the current channel.
  /UNCHOP <nick>    Remove channel-operator status from person.

  /WDETECTED        /Whois of the last person detected by /notify.

  /H+ and /H-       Quickies for /set hold_mode on and off.

  ^r is bound to type the 'reverse' character.

  Also some output representations are changed.
@endnode

@node BRC "Some aliases..."
@TOC LOADGR
Usage: /LOAD bitnet

  BITNET aliases and settings are defines here to make ircII look
  and feel like the BITNET Relay Chat (BiRC).

  Some of the BiRC commands can't be found in IRC, and some of the
  commands will display different outputs than those in BiRC.

  The display will reassemble as much of the BiRC that is possible.

  This script is version 1.30, Patchlevel 1
  This script is Copyright (C) Ove Ruben R Olsen (Gnarfer)

  The commands below are taken from the BiRC /Help command.

  A little script by BigCheese to demonstrate the usage of /echo $[].
  It displays all in and outgoing channel talk formatted to the 11th
  column.
@endnode

@node COMMANDER "Some aliases..."
@TOC LOADGR
Usage: /LOAD commander

  This file contains a big set of key bindings, one command for
  almost every key you have on your keyboard, prefixed by ESC.
  Both the ESCAPE and ` keys are defined as META1 control key,
  so if you do not have ESC you can use `.
  To obtain a ` you must type ` twice. If you type ESCAPE twice
  you'll instead get the ircII command completion function.
  TAB is defined as alternative META2 key, to toggle insert/overwrite mode
  type TAB twice. ESC-TAB clears the current window.
  Here's the definition of the keys after pressing ESC or `:

    A	Prompts you for an away message, ENTER will un-away you.
    C	Shows you the /NAMES entry of your current channel.
    D	Shows the Who-list of people of your country. ( = /countrywho )
    E	Prompts you for the launch of an external command with /EXEC.
    F	Follows an invitation to a channel.
    G	"Greet" - Enter a query with the last person whose signon has been
		detected by /notify.
    H	"Here" - Shows Who-list of users from your site. ( = /localwho )
    I	Invite the user who last sent you a message to the current channel.
    J	Shows the WHOIS of the person who last joined your channel.
    L	List of channels with at least 3 persons on unless with topic.
    M	"More" - Enter a query with the person you last sent a msg to.
    N	Names list of public channels having at least 2 persons on.
    O	Who-list of operators online.
    P	Make your channel private.
    Q	Exit a query.
    R	"Reply" - Enter a query with the person who last sent you a msg.
    S	Prompts you for a new server, ENTER gives a list of stored ones.
    T	Prompts you for a topic for the current channel.
    U	Tells you how many users and servers are on IRC.
    W	Gives you the Who-list of the people on your channel.
    X	"eXamine" - WHOIS of the person who last sent you a message.
    Y	Toggles the SCROLL mode.
    Z	Toggles the HOLD_MODE.
    ,	Flushes the server output.
    .	Clears the window.

@node CURSOR "Some aliases..."
@TOC LOADGR
Usage: /LOAD cursor

    I don't know why, it works on some terminals, on others it doesn't:
This should setup ircII to make the cursor keys on your terminal move
the cursor in ircII left/right and forward/back in command history.

Try it, maybe you are lucky.

Usage: /LOAD deutsch

This is only for the german-speaking part of the IRC community.

Hier ist nix sinnvolles drin, nur eine kleine Sammlung von Tastenbelegungen,

   For those who didn't like that ircII has special features for germans
only, here is just about the same silly thingie in english language.
This might however become obsolete if /me & co. become a standard.

If you load this script you get the following strings typed into your
ircII line as you type META2, that is ^w (CTRL-W) or TAB for those
who make use of 'commander' plus the character with or without SHIFT.

@node EVENTS "Some aliases..."
@TOC LOADGR
Usage: /LOAD events

  This script contains a collection of /ON commands which change the looks
  of some 'events' to something that I like more, maybe you like it, too?

  The person's nickname that last sent you a message will appear in
  your status-line, if you have %U in your STATUS_FORMAT variable.
  The output of /NAMES will look more compact.
  The output of /WHO will look different, too.
  When you type to a channel your nickname will be displayed as prefix to
  the line instead of just '> '.
  You will be informed about the time every full hour.
@endnode

@node FINGER "Some aliases..."
@TOC LOADGR
Usage: /LOAD finger

    The mythical /finger alias by BigCheese. Apparently it works again.
You can type /finger <nickname> and a 'finger' command is launched with the
user@host info for that nickname.
@endnode

@node FNET "Some aliases..."

@node IRCRC "The startup-file"
@TOC LOADGR
You could make up a nice .ircrc to start with, simply by writing these 3
lines into it:

load commander
load events
load alias

Read the helps to learn about what you get by using these scripts.
They are designed to bring much of ircII's power to the user's
disposition which is otherwise hard to get, because you'd have to learn
ircII's complex and unfriendly programming language.

About the key definitions, you get much faster in discussion if
you get acquainted to its use, especially of the fast /query bindings
which can help you switch between multiple conversations quickly.
@endnode

@node LOCAL "Some aliases..."
@TOC LOADGR
Usage: /LOAD local

  Local definitions, done by your ircII administrator are stored in here.
  Local is (should be) executed at ircII startup automatically.

  The most important aliases in here, are these two aliases:

  /COUNTRYWHO	Who-list of the people of your country.
  /LOCALWHO	Who-list of the people at your site.

  With 'commander' you have these commands on ESC-d and ESC-h respectively.
@endnode

@node MSG "Some aliases..."
@TOC LOADGR
Usage: /LOAD msg

    Contains some handy key bindings:
A variable LAST_WHOIS will always contain the person you last /whois'd.
A variable LAST_NOTIFY will contain the person that was last detected to
sign onto irc.

By typing META2 with ? you will be prompted '/msg <last_whois> '
With META2 and ! you'll get '/msg <last_notify> '

Additionally you also have META2-, which expands to
 '/msg <last person that sent you a msg> '
and META2-. to '/msg <last person you sent a msg to> '
analogue to the standard IRC shortcuts ('/msg .' and ',').

META2 is defined by /bind, by default it is ^x.

@node MUDLIKE "Some aliases..."
@TOC LOADGR
Usage: /LOAD mudlike

    ircII interface for people who like the way one communicates on MUDs.
It makes ircII act almost the same way:

Removes the / before commands, everything you type is supposed to be
a command. To speak to a channel use 'say <text>', to speak to a person
use 'tell <person> <text>' or use 'query <person>' and 'send <text>'.

When you 'load action' you get the 'smile' 'grin' commands which
ALSO transmit over a query! So be careful if you are in a query or not.

The ' symbol itself is a quickie for the 'send' command which either
sends to the query or the channel. If you type one space before text,
that is space as a command like this: ' <text>', it goes to the channel.

Much of the irc output is modified in a way that it looks more familiar
to MUDders.

'emote' behaves like 'me', see /help ME. Read also /help DESCRIBE

For more precise information try to read the script file itself.
@endnode

@node OPER "Some aliases..."
@TOC LOADGR
Usage: /load OPER

A collection of aliases for IRC operators:

/stick <new> <target>	/connect <new> 6667 <target>
/joinzone		/join #Twilight_Zone
/partzone		/part #Twilight_Zone
/joineuro		/join #EU-Opers
/parteuro		/part #EU-Opers

/loud			Show the wallops
/silent			Swallow the wallops away
/lastwallops		Should show the last wallop, but I think it doesn't
@endnode

@node PREFIX "Some aliases..."
@TOC LOADGR
Usage: /LOAD prefix

  For those who use multiple channels without opening windows
  for each of them. The channel name talk is coming from or going
  to is displayed as prefix to each line.
@endnode

@node REPEAT "Some aliases..."
@TOC LOADGR
This is a sample of using the WHILE command in an alias.  Once
loaded, here is it's usage:

Usage: REPEAT <cnt> <cmd>
  This will perform <cmd> for the number of times specified by
  <cnt>.  For example:
    /REPEAT 5 /msg bigcheese Hello!
  This will send the message "Hello!" to bigcheese 5 times.  
  The above example can get annoying, so try to not to use
  this to really bother people.
@endnode

@node SERVICE "Some aliases..."
@TOC LOADGR
Usage:  /LOAD service
  This script contains some aliases for the handling of
  NickServ and NoteServ which are shortcuts for the
  /msg NickServ/NoteServ - Sequences.
  You have to setup a Variable which contains your NickServ-
  Password with /ASSIGN PASSWD password in your .ircrc.
  When you then /LOAD SERVICE that password will automatically
  be sent to the NickServ.

  For NickServ :

   /.identify    /.whois

@node SILENT "Some aliases..."
@TOC LOADGR
Usage: /LOAD silent

  A series of /on commands, which will make all of the *** join, leave,
  signoff nickname and mode change messages disappear. Meant to be used
  in high-traffic channels such as +report.

  If you have %U somewhere in your STATUS_FORMAT variable, the messages
  will appear in the status line instead, which is much less annoying,
  than to have them in the ircII windows.

@node ON "About the ON-command"
@TOC ONGR
Usage: ON [+|-|^]<event> [-|^]<match> [action]
  The ON command lets you set up actions which will occur when
  certains events happen.  For example, you can create
  "personalized" away messages for different individuals,
  periodic actions that occur at specific times, just to name
  a few.

  Note that using ON JOIN and ON LEAVE to automatically greet
  people entering or leaving your channel is extremely poor
  etiquette. See /HELP ETIQUETTE.

  The <event> parameter specifies what irc event to monitor for
  possible execution of the action.  All possible events are listed
  after this file, and more specific help is available for each.

  There are four modes for each event.  Different modes
  are specified by preceeding the event with one of the
  following characters:
    +           Make event very noisy.  It will display
                everything it does.
    -           Make event quiet.  It will not display any of
                it's actions.
    ^           Make event silent.  Just like - above except it
                inhibits the normal event display as well.  The
                only command that will cause output in this mode
		is the ECHO command.  This can be used to redefine 
                how event messages look.
  If no character is specifed, you will be warned upon activation 
  of an event (this is somewhere between the + and - modes).

  The <match> parameter may be a single word, or a list of words 
  surrounded by double quotes (").  The <match> determines 
  specifically which events of the given <event> will cause 
  the action to take place.  The <match> may contain wildcards,
  and the specifics of the <match> parameter are dependant on
  the <event> type.  
  
  If the <match> is preceeded by a -, that entry will be
  removed from the action list.  For example:
	/ON PUBLIC -BigCheese
	/ON INVITE  -"* +Har"
  The first will remove "BigCheese" from the PUBLIC list, the second will
  remove -"* +Har" from the INVITE list.
  If you specify a - without a <match>, all entries on that list will
  be removed.  For example:
	/ON MSG -
  will remove all entries from the MSG list.
  
  If the <match> is preceeded by a ^, then no action will be taken
  for a match for that event (this is used when you wish
  to exclude a nickname or list of nicknames from a larger
  wildcard match, see HELP ON FLOOD for an example).  
 
  The [action] parameter is that action that will occur when the
  specified event occurs which matches the given <match>.
  The action parameter is parsed by the command parse in exactly
  the same way as an IRCII alias is parsed, using the same inline
  variable exapansions (See ALIAS).  Also, depending on the
  event that is activated, there will be certain values passed
  as arguements to the action, just as if they were arguments to
  an alias.  You may use the $0, $1, $2... etc variables to
  expand out these arguments.  The arguments passed for each
  event are described in the individual help files for each event.

  Here are some examples:
    /ON -MSG *cheese* NOTICE $0 No Cheese Messages Please!
  Whenver a MSG is received from anyone with a nickname with
  cheese in it, a NOTICE will be sent out to that user.  This
  action will generate no noticable effect to you (it is marked
  as "quiet").

    /ON MSG ^BigCheese
  If used with the first example above, this will prevent the
  action from being taken when a message is sent from BigCheese.

  Here is an example of how to redefine the way a
  message looks:
    /ON ^MSG * ECHO :$0: $1-
  All MSGs received from now on will look:

  :BigCheese: Hello!

  The same can be done with the other event types.

  More examples are given for the individual event types.

  /ON will not function if the NOVICE variable is set to ON.

        /ON INVITE  -"* +Har"
  The first will remove "BigCheese" from the PUBLIC list, the second will
  remove -"* +Har" from the INVITE list.
  You can remove all entries from a given event list by doing
  the following:
	/ON <event> -
  For example:
	/ON MSG -
  removes all entries in the ON MSG list.

  If the <match> is preceeded by a ^, then no action will be taken
  for a match for that event (this is used when you wish
  to exclude a nickname or list of nicknames from a larger

@node ONCTCP "An ON-command (do an action when something happens)"
@TOC ONGR
Usage: ON [+|-|^]CTCP [-|^]<parameters> [action]
  This event is activated whenever someone sends a client-to-client
  protocol (CTCP) request.  Certain CTCP types are have predefined
  actions that you can't override with the ^, but you can use the
  to create your own CTCP protocols.  The parameters are:
        $0      nick of person who send CTCP
        $1      who the ctcp was to (either your nick or a channel)
        $2      The CTCP command word
        $3-     Any additional arguments
  For example, if you want to set up a new ctcp function called 
  CHEESE, you  would do:
        ON -CTCP "* * CHEESE" /CTCP $0 $2 Say Cheese!
  Using the /CTCP in an ON CTCP automatically sends the proper 
  reply format.  If someone no send you a:
        CTCP <yournick> CHEESE
  you will see:
        *** CTCP CHEESE from <theirnick>:
  and they will see:

@node ONCTCP_REPLY "An ON-command (do an action when something happens)"
@TOC ONGR
Usage: ON [+|-|^]CTCP_REPLY [-|^]<parameters> [action]
  This event is activated when you receive a reply from a CTCP
  request that you made (with the CTCP command).  For example,
  if you did:
	/CTCP BigCheese VERSION
  you would receive a:
	*** CTCP REPLY VERSION from BigCheese: IRCII 2.1beta2 Unix
  from BigCheese.  However, if you had:
	/ON ^CTCP_REPLY "* VERSION" /echo $0 is using $2-
  and did the CTCP show above, you would get something like:
	BigCheese is using IRCII 2.1beta2 Unix
  The parameters are:
	$0	nick of person who sent the reply
	$1	The CTCP command being replied to
	$2-	The reply itself (depends on $1)
  Note: You may NOT use the CTCP command in an ON CTCP_REPLY.  
  It simply will report an error message to you and not work.  
  It is illegal to do this and it is not supported.

@node ONFLOOD "An ON-command (do an action when something happens)"
@TOC ONGR
Usage: ON [+|-|^]FLOOD [-|^]<nick> [action]
  The FLOOD type is activated whenever someone sends a lot of 
  information very rapidly to you, your channel, or the system at 
  large (ie: a wall).  Usually, this is caused when someone dumps
  a file to your channel or to you.  The parameters for this are:
    $0	The nick of the flooder
    $1	The type of flooding being done 
    $2- The content of the flooding message

  General use for ON FLOOD is as follows:
	/ON ^FLOOD *
  This will automatically prevent flooding messages from being 
  displayed and automatically disable itself when the flooding
  has stopped.

  If you use services like IRCIIHelp or NickServ, these can appear to
  IRCII as floods, but if you add to following ON lines:
   /ON FLOOD ^IRCIIHelp
   /ON FLOOD ^NickServ
  These will not be treated as floods and will let their messages through.

  Warning:  There are occasions where ON FLOOD can be inadvertantly 
  activated (such as after a net-burp, or after you have ^Z'd for a
  while).  Therefore, I strongly advise against using KILL or even
  KICK as the action taken by an ON FLOOD.

@node SETCOMMAND_MODE "Set a variable to set up IRC"
@TOC SETGR
Usage: /set COMMAND_MODE ON|OFF

This switch was designed for those who are used to MUDs and computer
freaks who like command oriented environments. It will disable the
command character! Every input of yours will be expected to be a command.
If you want to send something to your current channel or query, you'll
have to type "send <text>" or "'<text>".
"say <text>" will always send to the channel even if you're in a query.
With ":<text>" you get the same effect as with "me <text>".

The "'" and ":" abbreviations are introduced for MUD compatibility and
are only available in COMMAND_MODE.

@node SETDISPLAY "Set a variable to set up IRC"
@TOC SETGR
Usage: SET DISPLAY [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
  Turns ON or OFF all output.  It can be useful to SET DISPLAY
  OFF at the beginning of your .ircrc so you don't have to see
  everything it does every time you start irc.  Just remember to
  SET DISPLAY ON again at the end of your .ircrc.  NOTE: Setting

@endnode

@node SETEXEC_PROTECTIO "Set a variable to set up IRC"
@TOC SETGR
Usage: SET EXEC_PROTECTION [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
  If you saw a warning message telling you to read this, beware!
  If  anyone on irc told you that typing "/ON ^MSG * $1-" or 
  "/ON ^MSG <nick> $1-" would speed speed things up or otherwise
  make life better for you, they are lying.  The above commands 
  allow people to send you MSGs and have them executed as commands
  by your IRCII.  This can be a major security problem, since the
  person who told you to do this can then execute any command you 
  could, including EXEC commands.  This would give them control over
  your account while you are on irc.  

  Anyway, if you did see this warning, it could be that someone is
  trying to abuse your account.  But, don't worry, the EXEC command
  that it warned you about was not executed.  If you are unsure about
  what is going on, please contact your local irc operator for help.
  
  If you know what you're doing, you can set EXEC_PROTECTION to OFF
  and EXEC will be allowed within ON commands.  Only do this if 
  you are sure you understand what is going on.

  FLOOD_RATE can be set to the number of messages per second you 
  wish to  activate flooding. If messages from a user outpace 
  FLOOD_RATE for  FLOOD_AFTER number of messages, ON FLOOD is
  activated.  If FLOOD_RATE is larger then FLOOD_AFTER, then you 
  will end up seeing at least FLOOD_RATE messages before flood 
  activation (If FLOOD_RATE is 5 and FLOOD_AFTER is 3 then you must 
  receive at least 5 messages before the flood rate can be 5

@endnode

@node SETHISTORY "Set a variable to set up IRC"
@TOC SETGR
Usage: SET HISTORY <value>
  Sets the size of the command history circular buffer.  Setting
  HISTORY to zero disables the command history functions unless you

  turn off command history.

  See Also:
    @{" SET HISTORY_FILE " link SETHISTORY_FILE }
@endnode

@node SETHISTORY_FILE "Set a variable to set up IRC"
@TOC SETGR
Usage: SET HISTORY_FILE <path for history file>
  If HISTORY_FILE is set, then the command history is saved in
  this file rather than in memory.  The advantage to this is
  that the size of this file is limited by your disk space and
  doesn't increase the memory usage of IRCII.  The disadavantage
  is that history access might be slower (or it might not).  To
  disable the HISTORY_FILE, set it to <EMPTY>.  To completely
  disable the command history functions, you must also set
  HISTORY to 0.

@node SETHOLD_MODE "Set a variable to set up IRC"
@TOC SETGR
Usage: SET HOLD_MODE [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]

  is unlimited.
@endnode

@node SETINDENT "Set a variable to set up IRC"
@TOC SETGR
Usage: SET INDENT [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
  Setting INDENT to ON will cause lines of text that are longer
  than the screen width to be indented so that all lines after
  the first start underneath the second word in the first line.
  That's a long sentence, but that's what it does.  If you also
  have CONTINUED_LINE set, this will pad the CONTINUED_LINE
  characters out to the second word in the first line, unless
  CONTINUED_LINE is longer.  CONTINUED_LINE will not be
  truncated.  To disable the CONTINUED_LINE, set it to <EMPTY>.
  INDENT will never indent beyond 1/3 the width of the screen.

@node SETINPUT_ALIASES "Set a variable to set up IRC"
@TOC SETGR
Usage: SET INPUT_ALIASES [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
  Turns ON or OFF the expanding of aliases in the inputline, 
  .ircrc and LOADed files.  If you set INPUT_ALIASES ON and type:
    /ECHO $S
  you will see your server name echoed to your window.  If it is
  OFF, you will see $S echoed to your window.  If you turn this on
  in your .ircrc, it is usually advisable to do it as one of the 
  last lines in your .ircrc, otherwise other occurences of $ in your
  .ircrc may expand out strangely.  

  NOTE: If you do turn on INPUT_ALIASES in the .ircrc then the arguement
  expandos ($*, $0, $1, $3-4, etc) will expand to the command line 
  arguments passed to IRCII on startup.

@node SETLASTLOG_LEVEL "Set a variable to set up IRC"
@TOC SETGR
Usage: SET LASTLOG_LEVEL [ALL|NONE|[-]<level> [-]<level> ...]
  The setting of this variable determines which types of
  messages are stored in the lastlog.  If ALL is specified,
  everything that shows up on the screen is saved in the
  lastlog.  If NONE is specified, nothing is saved in the
  lastlog.  The <level> specification can be one of the
  following: 
    PUBLIC          Channel conversation
    MSGS            Private messages
    NOTICES         NOTICEs
    WALLS           WALLs

    USERLOG3        Reserved for the user
    USERLOG4        Reserved for the user
    CRAP            Anything not covered by the above categories
  You can combine these on a command line to make the lastlog
  save just what you want.  Also, by putting a - before any
  level, you remove that one from the list.  For example, if you
  wish to save everything except NOTEs and all that CRAP, you
  could do:
    SET LASTLOG_LEVEL ALL -NOTE -CRAP
  which is the same as doing:
-    SET LASTLOG_LEVEL PUBLIC MSG NOTICE WALL ACTIONS
