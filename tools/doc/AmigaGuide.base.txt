Global tags and commands

@node
    The start of a node, followe by a name and title. The title is displayed in Amigaguide\u2019s title bar, and the name is used to identify the node. Example: @node "Node name" "Node title"

Node-level tags and commands

These are placed inside a node, on their own lines, and effect the whole node.

@font
    The same as the global font command, but only effects this node. Example: @font safalra.font 12 
@help
    The same as the global help command, but only effects this node. Example: @help "A helpful node" 
@index
    The same as the global index command, but only effects this node. Example: @index "The index node" 
@keywords
    The keywords for this node. This information is not currently used by Amigaguide. Example: @keywords Torquay "English Riviera" Devon "Fawlty Towers" 
@next
    The next node, displayed when the user clicks the \u2018Browser >\u2019 button. This defaults to the next node in the document source. Example: @next "The next node" 
@prev
    The previous node, displayed when the user clicks the \u2018< Browser\u2019 button. This defaults to the previous node in the document source. Example: @prev "The previous node" 
@title
    Specifies the title of this node. This overrides the title specified in the @node tag. Example: @title "Node title" 
@toc
    The contents page, displayed when the user clicks the \u2018Contents\u2019 button. This defaults to the main node. Example: @toc "A contents node" 

Local tags and commands

These can be placed anywhere within a node.

@{alink}

@{bg}
    Specifies the background colour to use from the next character onwards. Valid values are \u2018back\u2019, \u2018background\u2019, \u2018fill\u2019, \u2018filltext\u2019, \u2018highlight\u2019, \u2018shadow\u2019, \u2018shine\u2019 and \u2018text\u2019. Example: @{bg background}
