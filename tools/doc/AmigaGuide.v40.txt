With the release of Workbench 3.1, many new tags and commands were added to Amigaguide, giving it formatting capabilities more advanced than the HTML of the time.
New global tags and commands

These can be placed outside of a node, on their own lines.

@macro
    Defines a macro. A macro consists of a name, and a string to substitute for it in the document. This string may contain arguments, refered to as $1, $2 and so on. A macro can override the built-in tags and commands. Example: @macro bulletlink @{" " link $2} $1 
@onclose
    Specifies an ARexx script to execute when the document is closed. The return value of the script is ignored. Example: @onclose "script.rexx" 
@onopen
    Specifies an ARexx script to execute when the document is opened. If the script returns an error code, the document is not opened. Example: @onopen "script.rexx" 
@smartwrap
    Wraps text in the same way as HTML. Paragraphs are separated by two linefeeds, or using the @{par} tag. Example: @smartwrap 
@tab
    Specifies the number of spaces in a tab. The default value is 8. Example: @tab 3 

New node-level tags and commands

These are placed inside a node, on their own lines, and effect the whole node.

@macro
    The same as the global @macro command, but only effects this node. Example: @macro bulletlink @{" " link $2} $1 
@onclose
    The same as the global @onclose command, but only effects this node. Example: @onclose "script.rexx" 
@onopen
    The same as the global @onpen command, but only effects this node. Example: @onopen "script.rexx" 
@smartwrap
    The same as the global @smartwrap command, but only effects this node. Example: @smartwrap 
@tab
    The same as the global @tab command, but only effects this node. Example: @tab 3 

New local tags and commands

These can be placed anywhere within a node.

@{amigaguide}
    Displays \u201cAmigaguide(R)\u201d in bold. Authors of other amigaguide viewers should change this to display their own information. Example: @{amigaguide} 
@{apen}
    Sets the pen number used for the text colour. The default value is 1. Example: @{apen 2} 
@{body}
    Use default formatting from the next character onwards. Example: @{body} 
@{bpen}
    Sets the pen number used for the background colour. The default value is 0. Example: @{bpen 3} 
@{cleartabs}
    Use the default tab stops from the next character onwards. Example: @{cleartabs} 
@{code}
    Turns off wordwrapping. Only linefeeds will cause new lines. Example: @{code} 
@{jcenter}
    Turns on centred text. Example: @{jcenter} 
@{jleft}
    Turns on left-aligned text. Example: @{jleft} 
@{jright}
    Turns on right-aligned text. Example: @{jright} 
@{lindent}
    Sets the indent, in spaces, to be used for lines of text. The default value is 0. Example: @{lindent 3} 
@{line}
    A linefeed that does not start a new paragraph. Example: @{line} 
@{par}
    Starts a new paragraph (equivalent to two linefeeds). Example: @{par} 
@{pard}
    Use default paragraph settings. Example: @{pard} 
@{pari}
    Sets the indent, in spaces, to be used for the first line of a paragraph. Example: @{pari 3} 
@{plain}
    Turns off bold, italics and underlining. Example: @{plain} 
@{settabs}
    Sets the tab stops, in characters. Example: @{settabs 4 8 12} 
@{tab}
    Inserts a tab character. Example: @{tab}
