Changes

With the release of Workbench 3.0, and the creation of the datatypes system, many changes were made to Amigaguide. With the creation of the datatypes system, a hyperlink can now point to any file (though it will only be displayed if a datatype is available for that filetype). The @{alink} tag now behaves the same as the @{link} tag, as it was considered bad practice to open new windows without the user's permission. As a result, the @{close} and @{quit} tags no longer work.
New global tags and commands

These can be placed outside of a node, on their own lines.

@wordwrap
    Wraps paragraphs without linefeeds. Example: @wordwrap 
@xref
    Specifies other amigaguide documents to refer to. Example: @xref "Documents:Amigaguide/safalra.guide" 

New node-level tags and commands

These are placed inside a node, on their own lines, and effect the whole node.

@embed
    Embeds a text document withing this node. Example: @embed "Documents:Text/speech.txt" 
@proportional
    Specifies that a proportional font is used for this node. Example: @proportional 
@wordwrap
    The same as the global @wordwrap command, but only effects this node. Example: @wordwrap 

New local tags and commands

These can be placed anywhere within a node.

@{b}
    Turns on bold text. Example: @{b} 
@{beep}
    Specifies a hypertext link that makes a \u2018beep\u2019 sound when clicked. Example: @{"Click me to beep" beep} 
@{guide}
    Specifies a hypertext link to another amigaguide document. Example: @{"Another amigaguide document" guide "Document:Amigaguides/safalra.guide"} 
@{i}
    Turns on italic text. Example: @{i} 
@{u}
    Turns on underlined text. Example: @{u} 
@{ub}
    Turns off bold text. Example: @{ub} 
@{ui}
    Turns off italic text. Example: @{ui} 
@{uu}
