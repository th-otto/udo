HELPDISC - Pure Pascal help file de-compiler
=================================================================

Idea, program, Copyright etc.: Joergen von Bargen (Maus HH)
Small improvements: Christoph Zwerschke (Maus KA)

With HELPDISC one can turn help-files  in Pure-Pascal format back 
into  source-files.  The Pure-Pascal  format is also incidentally 
used by the Pure-Profiler, but not by Pure-C v1.x.

So with HELPDISC one can:

 - Print out help-files
 - Correct or supplement help-files
 - Convert help-files to other formats (1st-Guide, ST-Guide).

Example:

From the help-file PP.HLP one can use

HELPDISC PP.HLP PP.TXT

to  reconstruct  the  source-file PP.TXT.  This file  can  now be 
printed out or corrected/supplemented with a text editor.

A warning in passing:  The source-files can become very long. For 
instance the  source-file for  UNIT.HLP  does not fit on a normal 
DS/DD floppy disk.  It's therefore desirable (also for reasons of 
speed)  to always  use a large RAM-disk or  hard disk for editing 
help-files.

From the source-file PP.TXT one can use the Pure Pascal help-file 
compiler HELPCOMP and the command-file

-V
PP.HLP
PP.TXT

to once again generate a help-file PP.HLP.

One can ignore the warnings 'link to unknown screen page-1'
-these are references to other help-files.

ST-Guide users can create from the source-file PP.TXT for 
Pure-Pascal using:

PC_CONV -a +n PP.TXT

a source-file PP.STG for ST-Guide.  From that source-file one can 
then finally use

HCP -a -n -s -oPP.HYP PP.STG

to create a hypertext-file PP.HYP for ST-Guide.
