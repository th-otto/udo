<short>This unit contains higher level grid widgets</short>

<element name="TfpgStringGrid.ShowGrid">
<short>Enable or disable grid line painting</short>
<descr>If enabled (the default), then grid lines are drawn around each cell.</descr>
</element>

<element name="TfpgStringGrid.OnDrawCell">
<short>This event allows you to do custom painting of grid cells</short>
<descr><p>ARow and ACol parameters should be obvious - they point to the cell being
drawn. ARect is the boundaries of the Cell being painted. AFlags contain some
state information about the grid. eg: Has the grid got focus, has the cell got
focus etc. ADefaultDrawing is set to True by default, which means the grid
will take care of painting the cell text for you (taking into account layout
and alignment settings of each column). If you set this to False, then you
need to paint the text yourself.</p>
<code>
procedure TMainForm.StringGridDrawCell(Sender: TObject; const ARow,
  ACol: Integer; const ARect: TfpgRect; const AFlags: TfpgGridDrawState;
  var ADefaultDrawing: boolean);
begin
  // two rows with different background color
  if (ARow = 7) or (ARow = 8) then
  begin
    if ((gdSelected in AFlags) and (gdFocused in AFlags)) or
       (gdSelected in AFlags) then
      Exit; // we want select cel to be painted as normal
    // If we got here, we must do some painting. The background first.
    StringGrid.Canvas.Color := clOrange;
    StringGrid.Canvas.FillRectangle(ARect);
    // NOTE: We want the grid to take care of the drawing of the text, which
    //  handles text layout and alignment, so we MUST NOT set the
    //  ADefaultDrawing to False. If we do, we need to handle text painting
    //  ourselves.
  end;
