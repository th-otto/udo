                   The fpGUI IDE Project
                   =====================

Description
------------
This project is a sample program representing a "lightweight IDE".
At the moment I am simply using this project as a playground for developing
and testing components, and for trying out other programming ideas.

If it ends up being a useful project and a workable IDE, that is just
a bonus. Due to my daytime work being all proprietary and closed source,
I can't showcase any of those real-world projects. My hope is that one day
this project will be a good showcase project in itself.


Status
-------
THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS! This project is NOT ready for usage yet.
